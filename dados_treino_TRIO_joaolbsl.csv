"Wanted to add in some more details that weren't mentioned by others! If you want to do astronomy then a degree in astrophysics is ideal; many universities will offer exactly this, or at least a degree in physics with a focus in astrophysics (both options are good). Modern astronomy *is* astrophysics! \n\nAlthough it is ostensibly possible to go from a bachelors in engineering to a graduate degree program in physics/astrophysics, it will be tremendously more difficult and you will have to take undergraduate physics classes as a graduate just to catch up. Engineering classes will not cover the requisite material!\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that degrees in physics and astrophysics are also *highly* marketable regardless of whether or not you go on to pursue an advanced degree.

"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry. I don't exactly want to make the excuse that I'm a physicist and not a philosopher, since understanding the ontology is important for the physics, but it is true that special relativity works. I trust it even though it's weird.",Physics

"The main problem is how we make them. We can make an atom or two at a time in a particle accelerator of basically all the super heavies, it's how we discovered basically all of them. We can also make macroscopic quantities up to Es or Fm in high neutron flux reactors (ie the HFIR at Oak Ridge). We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a ¬µg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-¬µg scales. Even the recent Es paper relied on a single spectroscopy that has an exceptionally low detection limit (XAS) rather than the traditional inorganic chemistry tool of SC-XRD, which requires a single crystal, typically of 10¬µg or more total mass.",Chemistry

"I‚Äòm sure that there are other good approaches to this, but this is what I would recommend.\n\nIf by ‚Äûpretty much nothing‚Äú you really mean nothing I would say start what at an atom is and how it is built. Learn what an orbital is and all these things. From there there are some very important principles like electronegativity which will lead you towards reactivity. Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration). If you don‚Äòt understand these things you won‚Äòt really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once you‚Äòve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry. They are very basic principles and maybe not the most interesting but as you learn more you will notice that you will encounter them quite often. And from there just see what you‚Äòre interested in and go for that.\n\nI guess organic chemistry might be a good start to understand some stuff that happens in nature and you can go into biochemistry from there if that seems interesting to you. \nJust be aware that if you want to check out organic chemistry depending on where you learn it from there might be a ton of reactions that are nice and cool but only relevant for synthesis and not for the sort of understanding you seem to be interested in.\n\nGenerally there are some good videos starting from the very basics on youtube if that‚Äòs something you like.",Chemistry
"Aromaticity is absolutely the driving factor. That said, biochemical systems don‚Äôt want *too much* stability in the oxidized form, as NAD+ is also used as an oxidizing agent. I think this is part of the reason a pyridinium shows up instead of benzene. The other, probably more important reason, is that the nicotinamide bit of NADH (the active reducer) is easier to biosynthesize than a benzene ring.\n\nFurthermore, cyclohexadiene wouldn‚Äôt hang around long enough in biochemical systems to be useful. It would react too indiscriminately. And biosynthesizing a *substituted* cyclohexadiene with the needed recognition elements to ‚Äústeer‚Äù the molecule into enzymatic active sites (the AD bit in NADH) would be darn near impossible.",Chemistry

"Well if you are getting 1000 ppm O2 within a minute, you either have a fairly big leak or your O2 sensor has gone bad. Or both. The classic test for the sensor is to open up some diethylzinc in the box and see if it smokes (indicating O2 > \~10 ppm). I am hesitant to recommend this, because if that 1000 ppm is real you will coat everything in the box with zinc oxide dust (and maybe start a fire). You could maybe do a ketyl test if you have the reagents. If you have a spare O2 sensor, I would go ahead and replace the current one and see what happens.\n\nA few questions: did you turn off the gas circulation before opening the MeI, and did you purge thoroughly after it was re-sealed? MeI is going to absolutely wreck the box catalyst if you are not careful. The O2 sensor may also be sensitive to MeI - those sensors typically have a lifetime of 6 months - 2 years, but they have somewhat sensitive surfaces that can be poisoned by exposure to certain chemicals.\n\nFinal question: is the H2O also shooting up, or is it just the O2? If it is both, that points to a leak, but if it is just O2, I would suspect the sensor.",Chemistry

"Short answer stick to cs and there are plenty of cs jobs in healthcare, unless you specifically want to go MD. \n\nChemistry or especiallh biology is, unfortunately still largely a black box and there's little logic behind any of them. There are, but ask around and most research got the result first then try to explain the logic behind it. The most math intensive thing in benchtop chemistry or biology is deriving ratios for buffer and REPEATING it many times. On top of that bio majors produces the most amount of graduates so you will be competing with these many fuckers for these kind of jobs. \n\n\nThe most mathy Chem class is, of course physical chem and unfortunately it's not there to guide chemical reaction designs yet. It's close I would assume but not there. People would rather swing up a round bottom flask in one hour than computationally investigate a reaction for two days. There's no doubt in silico drug design is a thing but it's not typically something you touch in undergrad, for reference my undergrad at gatech back in 2014 spent one semester of pchem in a 200 ppl class of quant Chem which I can safely say as someone got an A with 60% exam scores, nobody got what the heck was going on. Another semester is wasted in thermodynamics which became absolutely useless. \n\nBiology is even worse in terms of memorization. Ive done 300 level biochemistry and had became a ta in that course involuntarily in grad school and it's all about memorization of stupid cycles that nobody cares. At least you'd imagine they'd teach you how that cycle is logically discovered, but fuck no.\n\nAlso be warned a typical Chem or bio graduate has nothing to do with healthcare. The closest healthcare job you can get with a chem bs is some guy running hplc in hospitals, and for biology I can't see any. If you like drugs that much, at least try computational drug design. Synthetic chem is arguably an easy way to get into drug design but I don't see it fitting you at all, just find the synthetic Chem labs in your school and talk to the grad kids what they do.

"The frame of reference from this theory is the space-time itself. The expanding universe extends from the moving galaxies to the distance between atoms. So there is never a way to ""stop"" unless the universe stops expanding or contracts.\n\nYou might be able to test this theory by sending two atomic clocks in opposite directions at high speeds. One going counter to the direction of the rotation of our solar system relative to the spin of our galaxy and the other in the opposite direction. Even then, the time difference might also be only noticed if we counter of the spin of our galaxy. This may need to be conducted outside of our solar system.",Physics

"Welcome to this puzzling problem set\n\nI am currently doing a reaction in the lab, where I am working with a molecule that contains the moiety shown above.\n\nUpon treatment with base (Carbonate Buffer at ph 9 and 10 as well as in DMF with DIPEA) there are peaks/masses appearing on the LCMS and also it seems like the cleavage of the Thioester just stagnates after a certain point.\n\nIt took me a while to develop ideas what byproducts these masses on the LCMS could belong to\n\n**a:** shows the molecule before treatment with base. This mass also appears after treatment with base which I find quite confusing because I would expect the thioester to be completely broken up\n\n**b:** shows the molecule upon treatment: the thioester is cleaved and the thiol is freed (I also see the mass of the disulfide of b)\n\n**c:** shows the mass of my product without the acetyl-protecting group on the amine. This is something I find super surprising ‚Äì why should the acetyl be cleaved off? It's an amide, so‚Ä¶super stable? I know what you are about to say: maybe it's just something that happens in the LCMS through ionization! 1. there was an extra peak for this mass in the UV and molecule e also kinda proves that c really exists.  \nAlso, I expect **c** to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (**shown in d**). They do have the same mass\n\n**e** would be the disulfide formed between the free Thiol of b and d. Upon addition of TCEP to the mixture this mass vanished. This would also prove the S-N acyl shift theory\n\nSo:  1. why is there deacetylation happening in the first place?\n\nAnd here comes the biggest question mark: I have 3 substrates, they all look quite similar to a except they don‚Äôt have an acetyl-protected amine (they don't have an amine close to this position at all). Still, they all show these weird rearrangement (or whatever) masses. This would speak for another part of the molecule participating in these side reactions. (the structures drawn above are just interpretations of the masses based on the original molecule)\n\nDo you have any other suggestions about what could happen? Is there another shift I don‚Äôt know of between Amides and thioesters? Could the secondary Amine participate in this reaction (because the secondary amine is also present in every substrate)\n\nI am very confused by the outcome of this reaction and any ideas or suggestions would be very appreciated!",Chemistry

"Consider any point along the rope. The question now is, how is air resistance and gravity affecting the rope beneath it? That determines in which direction the rope beneath that point is pulling that point on the rope.\n\nWell, gravity is proportional to the mass of that length of rope, which is proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nAir resistance is proportional to the wind-facing surface area of the rope, which is *also* proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nSince these are both proportional to length, as you move down the rope, neither the downward effect of gravity or the approximately horizontal effect of air resistance is able to pull ahead, and the rope is just pulled in the same direction for the entire length.\n\n----\n\nHere is a more mathematically rigorous explanation:\n\nConsider an arbitrary length of the rope.\n\nIgnoring other attached segments of rope (which should behave identically), and thus their tension forces, there are two forces acting on the rope: gravity, and air resistance.\n\nNet air resistance is proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's wind-facing area is proportional to its length.\n\nNet gravitational force is *also* proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's mass is proportional to its length.\n\nThus, the net force is given by:\n\n- **F**_net = **F**_a + **F**_g = L\***f**_a + L\***f**_g = L\*(**f**_a + **f**_g)\n\nwhere **F**_a and **F**_g are air resist. and gravity, L is rope length, and **f**_a and **f**_g are the ""per-length"" air resist. and gravity forces.\n\nSince the rope is of uniform mass, **f**_g is constant for the entire rope, since gravity is approximately constant along the whole rope, which is short compared to the size of the Earth.\n\nIf we assume approximately constant air velocity and air density/makeup around the entire length of the rope, then we also get that **f**_a is constant for the entire rope.\n\nSince **f**_a and **f**_g are constant for the whole rope, so is there sum. This means that we have:\n\n- **F**_net = L\***k**\n\nwhere **k** = **f**_a + **f**_g is a constant vector.\n\nAll this math has resulted in the above equation, which alone tells us the rope should be straight and look like (B). The net force for every segment of rope along the rope, before accounting for tension forces, is in the same direction. When you add tension forces, those will only act parallel or anti-parallel to this net force.\n\nThus, the net force along the entire rope will be parallel to a constant direction, which is a straight line.",Physics

"Many molecules have chains of atoms, including almost all organic compounds like gasoline, sugar, proteins, etc.  \nThe central atom concept applies to each of the atoms in the chain, as a way to explain their geometries. For example, the molecule acetic acid (the sour part of vinegar) is C2H4O2. On one of the C atoms there are three H atoms and then the next C along. The four bonds around that carbon predict a geometry where the angles are roughly 109.5 degrees- the ‚Äútetrahedral‚Äù shape. Then the other C has a three bonds: one from the first C, a (double) bond to one of the oxygen atoms, and a bond to the second oxygen. With three bonds we‚Äôll say the best geometry is planar, with the bonds at 120 degree angles.

To explain this apparent CP symmetry, we invented a new particle axion.\n\nThis is a similar reason to why the Higgs particle was added.

The final velocity is given by **Vf=Vi+a t**. From this last equation, you get **a=(Vf-Vi)/t**. Replacing this into the displacement equation, you get **Œîx= (1/2) (Vf+Vi) t**.",Physics

"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management.

"Hirsch isn't looking to ""recreate the plots exactly.""\n\nAnd, in any case, doing so is not actually scientifically important. If there is fakery, recreating fake plots from fake raw data *does not actually test scientific truth.* (I will assume you include supplemental instructions along with the data, because the original manuscript is usually space constrained so it actually cannot give enough information to get from raw data to plots: that is the hand-holding I mean).\n\nIn a philosophical sense, there is always some faith you are placing in the provider of data that it is really the data that the instruments provided. You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says. There are too many assumptions made before the data is actually collected.",Physics

"Yes, you are measuring things.  Two differing reference frames, time, and The speed of the bullet in those reference frames, For starters.\n\nHow they get ""synced together"" (not a good phrase, but I'm going with it) isn't by doubling the speed of the bullet.  It is by using a Lorentz Transformation.  When the above posters talk about blue shifted light coming from the bullet this is related.  Due to the nature space-time warping at relativistic speeds the energies involved become a hindrance thus creating a cost for objects of mass in typical space-time system where they can't reach c.  As it creates an asymptotic energy cost to reach c.  Leaving us with a situation where it would look to the observer always less than c.  \n\nSo the observer would see, as you correctly said, the bullet travel from the gun to them in 10 seconds.  \n\nBut\n\nThe bullet would take a different time, differing reference frames and all that.  \n\nSo how do we rectify the two?  Which is where I think your question lies.  \n\nEvery time step (1 sec) light or some bit of information leaves the bullet AT the speed of light and reaches the observer.  It will always reach them first.  So, for the entire trip light is signaling the arrival of the bullet before the bullet in the bullets reference frame to the observer in the observers reference frame.  And since the bullet only goes 0.5c (and none faster) those bits of photons going c tell us the bullet never went c, regardless of how we experienced it.  \n\nLuckily we have blue shift and other measurements to tell us this rather accurately.  Because if we see, hear, feel, the bullet we have measured it.",Physics

Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years.

"The answer to that is kind of complicated, I‚Äôm no expert but I‚Äôll do my best to explain. A ceramic is pretty much a 3-dimensional matrix material arranged in a graphitic-type structure. It is generally made of silica and/or carbon mostly but there are plenty of other things that could be inside - mostly inorganic stuff like metals. They have characteristics like no glass transition temperature (which can kind of be thought of as a melting temperature in a layman sense), brittleness (because the chemical structure is highly croslinked and there arent many ways for the molecule to move and deflect energy, so it will simply break instead), heat resistance, and chemical/corrosion resistance. Ceramics can be made in many different ways, but my favorite type of ceramics are polymer-derived ceramics. In this method, you can take a silica based polymer and you basically just heat it up. At first the polymer crosslinks into a 3d shape, locking the shape in place. Then it pyrolyzes, where the less stable molecular structures are broken apart and volatilize out of the material. At high temperatures (like 1300 C) the bonds between the atoms are breaking chaotically and rearranging, and you end up with these carbon-rich domains which are basically graphite (this process is called graphitization) and silica rich domains. There are ways you can control the morphology to dramatically improve certain mechanical properties, but that gets into some complicated stuff.\n\nOh, and Ill add that a cool thing about polymer derived ceramics is that you can 3d print them, which is SUPER valuable for making intricate geometries like rocket engine components.",Chemistry

"Well it kinda depends on geometry but likely what is happening is that, you need to lean the bike hard to the right to keep the contact patch under the offset center of gravity, and that lean angle combined with the fork's offset forces the wheel to steer right. Fork offset changes steer angle in a lean - if there were no offset on the fork, the wheel would just flop to the side when driving straight because with a slackened steering axis, the wheel is actually at it's highest point when pointed straight, and 90 degrees to the direction of travel is it's lowest point. Due to the castor effect, fork offset causes the wheel to point forward when the bike is upright, but also causes the fork to self-steer into a lean due to the offset from the steering axis. A fork with zero offset would tend to point out of a turn while leaning. \n\nTL;DR: Bag is heavy on one side. Lean other direction to balance center of gravity.

With your eyes open you can see its a continuous wave propagating throughout the surface of the pond. But if you close your eyes, and put your finger just over the waters surface so that the wave barely touches it as it passes, would you still be able to tell it was a wave and not a single drop of water touching your finger? Same idea with particles: they are waves, but our only way of interacting with them directly makes us see them as particles.\n\n(I think, lol)",Physics

What I've said in this regard is that when you're trying to collect CO2, and investigate the thermodynamics of it, you actually have to account for the extra energy that the exhaust provides to the overall system by virtue of capturing energy from the Sun.

"Observing IS interacting! There is no way to measure the result of the experiment without interacting with the wave. I believe the use of the word ‚Äúobserving‚Äù with quantum experiments is really misleading. There is nothing special about us that changes quantum behavior by consciously observing the experiment - ANY interaction between waves will cause it to collapse, regardless of whether we see it happen or not. If a photon impacts a mote of dust in the atmosphere and scatters, did its wave not collapse at the moment it collided just because no one was around to see it happen? \n\nIf you shoot electrons through a double slit onto an electron detector with your eyes closed and don‚Äôt look at the results, the interference pattern will still be on the detector. Observer or no observer, the electrons still collapse onto the detector in the same way. \n\nObserving is simply the conscious recording of an interaction - it is the interaction that causes the wave to collapse, not the observation.",Physics

"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air‚Äôs volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate‚Äôs downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air‚Äôs acceleration along the escape path. The air‚Äôs inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate‚Äôs downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it‚Äôs on a more pronounced ‚Äúair cushion‚Äù but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air‚Äôs pressure to remain high. Now that the plate‚Äôs weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it ‚Äúslides downhill‚Äù on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate‚Äôs slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics

Most of the stuff that you can imagine is already well-understood unless you‚Äôre a research chemist.\n\nBroadly speaking, you identify characteristics of compounds and use that to predict how it will behave. Is it an acid/base? Is it a reducing/oxidizing agent? Is it radioactive?\n\nOnce you know enough chemistry, you can have a vague idea of how to answer those questions and what those answers will mean in the context of a particular system.

"Part answer to your question: there's so much chemistry we don't know of the first 92 elements. Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive. Radioactivity makes them difficult to use from a chemistry perspective. If you make an Es complex, it will only stay an Es complex for as long as the isotope exists. When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes. A chemist cares a lot more about ""what can I do with it"", and for heavy metals, the answer is, not a lot.",Chemistry

The phrasing you used to characterize inflation makes it sound like you would consider *any* solution to be a ""hack"" simply because it would be more complicated than current models without any solution, and that seems misguided.

Repeat for all unknown variables.

Chemistry is broad and it doesn't mean you will be qualified for any one job or that a job will be given to you.

I found two methods for selectively protecting a phenol in the presence of a primary alcohol - one with trityl (very difficult product to isolate and low yield) and one method doing a very similar transformation protecting with ethyl carbonate, mesylating the primary OH and reacting with DEA to add the amine and deprotect in one step. Very low yield. Also tried tosylating and similar outcome. Did a reaction with PBr3 and got the primary alcohol selectively transformed but low yield and not sure if I'll have difficulty adding the amine there in the presence of a phenol. One of the major byproducts I've gotten when attempting to add amine is the elimination product to get a monosubstituted alkene so I've tried using different bases to deprotonate the DEA but doesn't seem to be helping.

You could argue that CO2 capture technology and companies are bad because they might enable fossil fuel use rather than switching over to renewables, so that the government wouldn‚Äôt pass legislation that reduced fossil fuel consumption. On a practical level, this type of argument is a reasonable concern, and I think that it‚Äôs important to keep in the public discourse around carbon capture. At the same time, direct air capture had the potential to be so valuable in terms of removing historic CO2 emissions that I don‚Äôt think we should just ignore it because of its potential to be misused.

So you can swap the ""colour label"" between particles/quarks and the system is invariant. This is the essence of symmetry.\n\nEdit:\nI took a quick glimpse at the QCD Lagrangian, and I think that two quarks with equal colour state experience a different interaction than two quarks with different colours. It is evident in the structure constants (which are anti-symmetric). You can also imagine that since they are fermions, quarks will behave differently when their states are similar/equal.",Physics

"It‚Äôs unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn‚Äôt even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth‚Äôs temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I‚Äôm not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren‚Äôt able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn‚Äôt have replaced oil. It also wasn‚Äôt merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don‚Äôt make a compelling case for why we shouldn‚Äôt try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics

"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.",Chemistry

"I‚Äôm sorry. I don‚Äôt think you are considering the thermodynamics relevant to the situation. \n\nI don‚Äôt know what you mean by ‚Äúfiltering the atmosphere to get to the adsorption part.‚Äù The adsorption of CO2 is the same thing as the filtering. The point is to have an adsorbent that is selective for CO2 over other atmospheric gases. \n\nHere are two examples explaining why I don‚Äôt think your analysis is correct. First, rather than direct air capture people are working on capturing CO2 from a coal or natural gas flue stream. As mentioned in my previous comment, a coal plant will produce a good deal more CO2 than a natural gas plant will for the same amount of energy generated, but this actually doesn‚Äôt matter so much for the point I‚Äôm trying to make besides making it likely that you would want a different adsorbent material for the the two cases. If what you‚Äôre saying is correct, this work would be a completely pointless endeavor. In order to capture the CO2 from the fossil fuel plants, you would have to generate as much energy as they are generating with renewables. There would be no reason to do this if you were correct, yet this is a very active area of research that gets funding from the DOE and other sources. This is more of ‚Äúproof by authority‚Äù than actually addressing your point with a physical argument, but I mention this because it‚Äôs one of the main reasons that I initially was skeptical of your claim. There are likely many hundreds or thousands of scientists currently working on, evaluating, and funding this type of research that your apparently simple argument based on the second law of thermodynamics renders pointless. It seems unlikely to me that so many people just haven‚Äôt considered this claim, especially since process modeling on the economic and materials cost of these materials is common as well and in that type of modeling, they develop sophisticated thermodynamic and kinetic models of CO2 capture in specific materials. They wouldn‚Äôt continue doing this if it were as simple as just having to input as much energy as you initially got out since then it would be a pointless task. \n\nThe second example is one I alluded to in my previous comment. Suppose in one case that all of our historical emissions were from coal plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_c. Suppose in another case that all of our emissions were from natural gas plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_n. In both cases there would be the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but E_n > E_c since natural gas emits less CO2 than coal for the same amount of energy generated.  By your argument, in these two scenarios, we would have to generate different amounts of energy to capture this carbon dioxide. This doesn‚Äôt make sense, however. Once the carbon dioxide is in the air, it doesn‚Äôt matter how it got there. We aren‚Äôt trying to turn the CO2 back into coal or back into natural gas. Instead we are trying to get it to bind to some material, and the energy required to make the material and unbind the CO2 later (if that‚Äôs required for storing it underground) will be fixed for the same material capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, regardless of the source of the CO2 initially. The material doesn‚Äôt care if the CO2 came from coal or a fire or from a person breathing. \n\nTo address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. After absorbing light it doesn‚Äôt permanently stay in an excited state. \n\nYour fart example misses the point again. The point of carbon capture isn‚Äôt to end up with coal or natural gas or whatever else as a byproduct of CO2 capture. The point is going from coal -> CO2 (and other things) -> CO2 bound to some material. It isn‚Äôt trying to make something a reversible process.",Physics

The rope is pulled down by its own weight, but is trying to be blown horizontal by the air resistance. At the top of the rope, there is more weight from the rope below pulling down, so the air resistance is less able to blow it sideways and the rope hangs straight-er down. Nearer the bottom there is less weight pulling down on the rope, so the air resistance can blow the rope horizontally more easily.",Physics

But if we look at the organic chemistry side, halogens in general (chlorine) increases the lipophilicity of drugs. Also, chlorobenzene is an aryl halide so the intermolecular forces of it is Van Der Waals or London Dispersion, which makes it nonpolar or lipophilic.

"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes. The lists of ""health hazards"" is practically limitless. But ""hazard"" is a sliding scale. You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry

There's not freedom to make up new nonsense. The usage of ""dark sector of invisible particles"" means something specific to physicists. A term like ""dark"" often means ""not interacting with light"" -- e.g. if you're not in the light you're in the dark. It's not dark in the ""black magic"" sense. ""Sector"" often refers to some subset of matter fields and their coupling to some other subset of force carrying fields and the ""group representations"" that describe their relations. A ""dark sector"" here would be described by very familiar mechanisms and math and just would be an addendum onto our normal standard model description. \n\nAn analogy to explain why people are annoyed by your comment would be putting together a puzzle.

"To make it easier to see that the center ring is indeed an 18 electron system, pretend the benzene rings don't exist and assign electron counts to the atoms and charges in the central main ring then add them. eg. C and N are 1 each [as long as the Nitrogen is not connected to more than 2 atoms in a ring system other than the outward pointing R groups eg. in quinozolium the Nitrogen counts as 2 electrons] and every excess electron in the negatively charged ring is 1 each. There are 6 Nitrogens, 2 extra electrons and 10 Carbons which sums to 6 + 2 + 10 = 18.\n\nAnother way is to again, erase the benzene rings and draw the center ring without them attached. You'll end up with 7 double bonds and 2 amine like Nitrogens in one of the resonance structures that you can draw. Each double bond counts as 2 electrons and each amine like Nitrogen also counts as 2 which results in a total count of 7 x 2 + 2 x 2 = 18.\n\nWhile the benzene rings do interact and share electron density with the central ring, for most purposes they can be treated as separate ring systems.",Chemistry

During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.",Physics

The contribution cancellation you describe may hold at any given loop-order in the perturbative expansion of the vacuum energy coming from QFT. The problem with gravity is that it‚Äôs non-renormalizable. If you did the procedure you discuss above at a given loop-order, at the next level of the expansion, you‚Äôd have to perform another tuning, one independent of the first. QFT‚Äôs vacuum energy is radiatively unstable in the presence of classical GR. \n\nFurthermore, in saying the QFT prediction is terrible, I meant that if one wanted the 1-loop contribution to be THE dark energy, one would hope that contribution matches the observed value, or is close. Due to the mismatch, one has to rely on a fine tuning which then removes the ability to predict the vacuum energy.\n\nFinally, this all assumes that DE is a cosmological constant (cc), which isn‚Äôt actually required by the data.

So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.  Because it's neutral and almost hydrophobic, that allows it to penetrate through the grease to the substrate and then start to swell the grease layer from underneath.  Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.

"Great question!  It does in fact take more power to maintain a constant acceleration at increasing speed.   You can manipulate basic equations around to come up with P = F x V which clearly jibes perfectly with your observation that KE is exponentially increasing with constant acceleration.   So how do you explain a rocket, is it getting free energy (or free power) from a constant thrust force?  The answer is no of course, so what‚Äôs actually happening?   At the instant you light the engine, the power put into the rocket is zero because it‚Äôs velocity is zero.   All of the energy actually went into the exhaust gasses moving downward at high speed.  (You can check your instincts about zero power going into the rocket here by asking what would happen if it stayed bolted to the ground).   Then as the rocket accelerates more and more of the power goes into feeding its KE and less and less goes into the downward velocity of the exhaust.   Keep in mind we‚Äôre not doing relativity here, so from a stationary vantage point, with constant rocket acceleration you see each progressive bit of rocket exhaust coming out with a slower and slower absolute downward velocity.  It has less and less power going into it, which cancels with the rocket‚Äôs increasing power given by F x V.",Physics

"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell.

"My lab was not the most smelly lab in the world. We did not make any iffy 'fine' organic synthesis. Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to.

"This is wrong, as has been mentioned elsewhere.\n\nWe know a ton about DM and it is not a placeholder for anything. We know how much of it there was at the point of last scattering due to precision measurements of the CMB's temperature temperature correlation (as well as from polarization information). We also know how much there was due to measurements of the abundances of light elements. It is because these two measurements agree that we *really* believe that DM is what we think it is. But we also know its radial profile in galaxies, that it doesn't interact with regular matter much, that it doesn't interact with itself much, that it clumps, that this clumpiness dictates the large scale structure of the universe, and probably other things that I'm forgetting. All of these things point to a self consistent picture of a cold fluid that has thermally evolved like matter and has been present in corresponding densities since the very early universe.\n\nA lot of non-physicists have this idea that DM is just rotation curves and nothing else. That is *not* why we believe DM exists, although it is one more data set that points to a consistent picture, and it is the first data set pointing towards DM, but far from the most precise.\n\nAs for DE, it is also not a placeholder. We see that we have recently (a few billion years ago) entered into a DE dominated era where the evolution of the Hubble parameter is increasingly dominated by DE. The primary data set for this is type 1a SNe. While this data set is tricky, there are a large number of independent checks of DE, notably intrinsic curvature. In addition, we have looked for higher order moments in the acceleration of the universe and not found any, suggesting that DE is what we think it is. Finally, we know that the equation of state of DE is close to -1 as expected from the cosmological constant.\n\nWhat is going on right now in these areas? Many things. For DM, people are using the open data from experiments like GAIA to detect substructures in the galactic DM halo, which is mind boggilingly awesome. As for DE, with upcoming experiments like Vera Rubin we will increase our SNe data set by orders of magnitude.\n\nFinally, the dark sector mentioned in this article isn't the same as dark energy or dark matter, although it could be. Despite the fact that these names all sound related and very vague - dark sector, dark matter, dark energy - they are distinct things. The article is about neutrinos and an anomaly at 4.8sig that just got weirder: obvious explanations don't work so people are turning to less obvious things. This is the way discoveries work. Something strange happens in the data (MiniBooNE sees an excess), the simplest interpretation is investigated (a sterile neutrino), so follow up experiments are built to robustly test this. MicroBooNE just reported their first test of MiniBooNE's excess and, in a different kind of experiment, they don't see it. But the MiniBooNE result has been checked to hell and back, it is pretty hard to believe that it is just an experimental problem, although it could be. Thus people are considering new physics scenarios other than sterile neutrinos and these scenarios often go under the umbrella term of dark sector, although it's a pretty shit name just like dark matter and dark energy.",Physics

"This is a new proposal, fresh on the arXiv today, from a group of U.S. particle physicists. The introduction is very readable and lays out the mission clearly:\n\n> We can now confidently claim that the ‚ÄúStandard Model‚Äù of particle physics (SM) is established. At the same time, we are more and more strongly persuaded that this SM is incomplete. [...] It is now common to describe the SM as an ‚Äúeffective‚Äù theory that should be derived from some more fundamental theory at higher energies. But we have almost no evidence on the properties of that theory.\n\n> Our successes have become a liability in reaching this goal. Scientists from other fields now have the impression that particle physics is a finished subject. They question our motivations to go on to explore still higher energies. The scale of an energy frontier collider is also challenging to the young people in our field. They need to see qualitatively new capabilities realized during their active scientific careers. [...] That is where the urgency lies.\n\n> [T]he entire C3 program could be sited in the United States. With the cancellation of the Superconducting Super Collider and the end of Tevatron operations the US has largely abandoned construction of domestic accelerators at the energy frontier. C3 offers the opportunity to realize an affordable energy frontier facility in the US. This may be crucial to realize a Higgs factory in the near term, and it will also position the US to lead the drive to the next, higher energy stage of exploration.\n\nThe main innovation is that they propose to use _non_-superconducting cavities, which allow much higher accelerating fields, cooled to increase their quality factor. The resulting shorter length dramatically decreases the cost, to an estimated $4 billion, which is 80% to 90% less than other proposals. Of course, $4 billion is no small amount of money, but for perspective that's about equal to the monthly budget of the National Institutes of Health, a third of the cost of the James Webb Space Telescope, or 2% of the total cost of the space shuttle.",Physics

"Why would this be a process you attempt in situ? You're telling me you'll design an entirely new nuclear reactor based entirely on the idea that it might maybe form something somewhat beneficial? I mean, you're talking about introducing a fuel rod, a reflector and a gas  into a reactor. Just with fuel rod and reflector, you would at a minimum need to completely overhaul a reactor to swap it out to your newly designed fuel rod and reflector. Plus you'd need to introduce a gas stream into the system which gets very complicated. Cooling efficiency would change dramatically... so... I really don't see any other option than complete redesign. I'm also not sure what you're doing about cladding. Every fuel rod I know of is encased in a cladding material that would prevent the formation of the uranium nitride you want since that uranium is not exposed to the NH3. I'm willing to bet that a basic solution is not ideal for the system, either. \n\nI don't know the decay chains of everything so I'll just take your word that a neutron will create 15-N. Presumably that will be most efficient at a certain neutron velocity so why wouldn't you take a nitrogen source to something like a spallation neutron source or just another reactor (there's a few designed as neutron sources) where you can convert it to 15-N with significantly higher efficiency?

Now, the further Electromagnetic waves travel, the higher the redshift is measured with an ""infinite redshift"" at the event horizon of our observable universe. \n\nDoes that mean the wavelength of those photons approach 0 and wouldn't that also mean, that energy density decreases with time and distance , leading to the curvature of spacetime to ""flatten"", but since energy is always conserved, wouldn't that also mean that space seemingly increases?

"""not influenced by internal or external stimuli"", how can anything do anything if it doesn't have a reason to?\n\nIf free will is being unfettered by things like instinct (internal stimuli) that drive me to eat when I'm hungry and avoid bodily harm (external stimuli perceived as ""danger""), then an actor with free will should be just as likely to step into traffic and die as not, with the randomness of a coin flip. I think your definition of free will is insufficient.\n\nIn AI and economics there is the concept of an agent with goals. A rational agent acts to achieve some goal (win the chess game, get the car to the destination) by choosing actions, or sequences of actions, based on their perceived utility towards achieving that goal. Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\n\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations. I think the search for ""free will"" ultimately demands a distinction without a difference and uninteresting compared to studying biology, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.\n\nThis is a very liberal arts degree take (as my psychology and sociology education ends at the 200 level in the New York state undergraduate system), but I like Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development as a starting point for modeling and qualifying different types of actors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development\n\nHe distinguishes the person (often as stages of life from infancy to adulthood) who only makes choices to avoid negative stimuli (punishment, hunger), with a person who acts toward some perception of right and wrong, and from there distinguishes where they get their sense of right and wrong-- does their friend group or society dictate their morals or do they have their own moral system that they would listen to over the rules society provides.\n\nIt's very simplistic and self contradictory.

"Thallium possesses several closed shells of d and f-electrons, but once they are completely filled they tend to become irrelevant. (hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed. It may be possible that stuff like CsTl exists, but I would not bet on it.",Chemistry

"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today ‚Äî these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics ‚Äî or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people ‚Äî humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension ‚Äî are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics

"Yes, top research jobs usually go to PhD and ScDs.  AS degreed applicants are usually hired as technicians.  BS chemists are sort of caught in the middle.  Don't restrict your field of fire for those resumes.  Research labs are not the only place where chemists are hired.  Consider manufacturing plant positions.  Third shift if necessary to get your foot in the door.  Consider chemical sales jobs. Or technical writing jobs.  The second piece of advice I can offer is to highlight what skills, knowledge and interests and hobbies you have in addition to chemistry and data analysis.  It's pretty obvious that knowledge of a foreign language will vastly reduce the pool of competitors for positions in global chemical companies or those who want or need to deal internationally.  But not so obvious is that if you can play the violin, you will be irresistible to a lab where there is already a cellist and a pianist.  A chemist who plays golf will have an advantage in a company with a golf culture.  Third, use your computer skills.  Research companies and institutions and their employees and management for intelligence and places where your interests are a fit.  If you are a bowler, find organizations with a bowling team or league. Target or retarget nearby chemist employers.  Locate the bar nearest to the lab and frequent it at lunch time.  Or if your research turns up information that a manager is active in a civic organization, join up.  Remember to tell yourself as a chemist, you are a problem solver.

There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics

"> You don't need to be skeptical. \n\nSkepticism is the heart of science.\n\nThe issue here is that there's no opportunity to build pressure. As soon as the pressure on the lid exerts a force slightly greater than the weight of the lid, the lid moves and the pressure is lost. Thus we would not expect the lid to move very much, regardless of the weight.\n\nThe proffered explanation relied on a lid which was both heavy enough to build up pressure to move the lid dramatically, and light enough to be moved dramatically. That's a problem for the explanation; skepticism is warranted.\n\nOthers have suggested a sticky-lid mechanism, which seems likely to adequately explain this. I suggest that's the piece missing in the explanation.",Physics

"Basically none unfortunately. If you look at commercial lithium ion batteries they will use some combination of propylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate as a solvent the lithium hexaflurophospate or perchlorate as the salts.\n\nThe reason they need to use these really large counterions is that they are the only salts that are soluble in those solvents. Really highly ionic salts like sulfates are barely soluble in anything but water. They will be slightly soluble in things like ethanol or methanol but the problem with them is they are quite unstable (electrochemically speaking) which means you won't be able to reach high voltages at all.\n\nAlso going to non-aqueous immediately introduces the problem of water sensitivity, your salts will likely be wet and even if you do find a cheap solvent that will dissolve the salts in a desirable concentration then it too will suck up water from the atmosphere over time which can have an effect on performance (again reducing voltage stability)",Chemistry

If I have a given basis then I can say that the vector (1,1,1) has all positive coefficients, but in another basis they could easily be negative. It's a property of the representation, not the represented object.\n\nThe possible states of particle spin occupy a 2D *complex* vector space. *One* choice of basis is to take spin up to be (1,0) and spin down to be (0,1). The other spin states will then be combinations of these, some of them involving complex coefficients in general. But the same is true if you picked a basis where spin out is (1,0) and spin in is (0,1), and then wrote spin up/down in this basis. Up/down is not special (as it can't be, since physics is rotation-invariant).",Physics

If you want to go into tech instead then you need better than ""basic"" programming skills.

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/YufGuTz.png) is a plot I just found from googling, it's in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11033) paper which is in PRD. The x-axis is the scale factor which is related to time; the right side is today, the left side was a long time ago. The y-axis is the fractional energy density. Don't worry about the different line styles, they are details of the specific model in this paper. But in general we see that the universe used to be radiation dominated (teal), but radiation redshifts away very quickly and its energy density goes like a^-4 . Next we have a matter^1 (brown) dominated region since its energy density decreases only like a^-3 . But there is also dark energy (purple) whose energy density remains constant in time: a^0 . So it was always there but when you realize the x-axis is logarithmic, it isn't surprising that each one turns on/off fairly suddenly.\n\nAs for the future, see LSST now VRO, their physics cases are outlined [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/0805.2366).

It continues to survive robustness tests.

My body was still travel in a straight line due to inertia. From the bike‚Äôs perspective my body‚Äôs center of gravity would no longer be centered on the seat and tires and would start to cause a torque which tilts the bicycle right. The tilt causes the handlebar to then straighten out which aligns the bike‚Äôs trajectory to my body‚Äôs and therefore the bicycle continues on forward.

"In this visualization, I show the wavefront propagation of a coherent light beam (i.e., a simple laser) after passing through a holographic film, on where I previously recorded the relative information corresponding to the phase and amplitude of the object to be reproduced.\n\nPrecisely, the recorded film needs to reproduce the Fourier transform of the object up to an arbitrary phase factor.\n\nAn experimental technique for recording the hologram is interferometry; that is, a second wavefront, mutually coherent with the first and of known amplitude and phase, is added to the wavefront produced by illuminating the object we want to reconstruct. The holograms can also be entirely generated by a computer, like the ones shown here.\n\nThe standard recording material for the holographic film is a silver halide emulsion. Spatial light modulators, which are based on a LCD, can be used for creating real-time varying holograms. Finally, with the advent of nanofabrication techniques, today we can also create metasurfaces to do the task and mold optical wavefronts into almost any arbitrary profile over several wavelengths.\n\nThis technique can be used as well for displaying an arbitrary 3D object, but for a more quality reconstruction, a bit more complex setup is going to be required, for example, by performing oblique illumination on the holographic film.\n\n[The source code I implemented for propagating the wavefront and creating the holograms can be found here.](https://github.com/rafael-fuente/Diffraction-Simulations--Angular-Spectrum-Method)\n\nHappy Halloween to everyone üéÉ",Physics

"I'm sure someone will write on a way cleaner way since i'm going from memory.  \nAll of them come from the 3 dimensional wave function, do note that the 3d z\^2 may also be written as 3d z\^2 - r\^2 (after all, you'll probably be solving it in spherical coordinates and later returning to cartesian coordinates). If you really want to know more specific details such as where do each wave function comes from and how to write them you'll have to look on a quantum mechanics books, the expressions can get quite extensive.   \nWith that in mind, the squares can be easilly associated with the probability densities (squared wave function), since that is what you'll be seeing the orbital plots, and with some (really large) degree of freedom of speech, try to imagine the xy, xz, zy as solutions where the variables are correlated, justifying the fact that is never purely in the x or y (and so on) axis. For the x\^2 - y\^2 think of them as a linear combination of non-correlated variables to form the general solution, thus the highest probability wont be on a region where the (x\^2 , y\^2) combination is at it's maximum but where either (x\^2 , 0) or (0, y\^2) is being maximized.   \nThe biggest problem with this analogy comes from the z\^2 - r\^2 one, here you'll need to have some revolution solids in mind, since it's quite easy to see that the density regions are separated by a 3-dimensional cone instead of a traditional cartesian axis, that's where the r\^2 may help to visualize its formation. Try plotting a surface such as z\^2 - x\^2 - y\^2 and note that the 3d z\^2 solution lies inside the cone and around it.   \nHowever, do realize, this is just an (way) overly simplified justification, you'll need to check the wavefunction solution for each case to really get a picture of whats going on behind the scene and it's now that hard to find a table of such solutions.

"PhD chemist here\n\nI took chem, Phys, maths at A level (these tend to lower entry offers from universities, usually maths + a science or 2 sciences, drops entry requirements by about a grade each).\n\nBoth of those routes are pretty clear cut coming from a chem degree, both benefit from wet lab experience, instrumentation experience etc.\n\nDoing research now for my PhD. \n\nThe good: some of the time you're doing something new / not done before by anyone else. When it works it's a special feeling. The highs are pretty high. And the variety / challenge is awesome. And if you have a good lab group, it's 10x more fun.\n\nThe bad: ""it's not research if you're not failing 80+% of the time"". You need to be able to fail at something that feels like it should be succeeding. Repeatedly. It takes a certain kind of person to do research, you need emotional resilience, and the ability to not take it personally when things aren't working.\n\nMy advice:\n\nGo to university, do a chem degree, work out what parts of the course you like, what parts you don't like, take modules based on your interests at the time, then make an educated decision later.",Chemistry

"Need some advice for my sister who is a Chem major. She's unsure if to switch to BS in Chemistry or stick with BA for her career goals.\n\nShe's most interested in nuclear chemistry but could also see herself working as a food chemist as well. Earlier in college she was planning on going to Pharmacy school but has some reservations since she claims to not be good with biology. However, she doesn't want to close the door on it completely and may consider Pharmacy school again if she can't find a chemistry position.\n\nHer university offers a BA and BS degree in chemistry. After going through her potential timelines, there are only a few differences. The biggest difference is that BS degree only accepts two semesters of Calculus based Physics. While the BA accepts two semesters of college physics (algebra-based?). The other difference is that BS requires two semesters of research OR an internship. But BA doesn't require either to graduate, though she will obviously still try to get an internship if possible.\n\nShe already has one college physics course completed and I'm personally thinking she should just stick with BA but I don't want to give her bad advice. It's possible switching to BS may add another year to her schooling due to the possible research requirement if she doesn't get an internship.

"As someone else mentioned, yeah, it's the weak interaction that's weird in this way, not neutrinos. And since all leptons and quarks have a weak interaction (or a component with a weak interaction) it has very weird consequences with how particles gain mass.\n\nIn principle a particle could have multiple effects that give mass and they'd just add up to the physical mass that we observe. And there is one super simple way to add a mass term to the Lagrangian (the Lagrangian allows you to then calculate how stuff moves and interacts and stuff). You just write m \* psibar \* psi where psi and psibar are the fermion and its antiparticle in question and m is some free parameter that is the particle's mass. But because all those fermions interact with a field that picks out the left handed side, such a term is forbidden. Peter Higgs, and others, realized the solution to this: let every fermion couple to a new field and then let this field be non-zero everywhere. This gives something that is equivalent to the above mass term in every way, but also respects the left handedness of particles. This is known as electroweak symmetry breaking and over the last decade has been confirmed to be how reality works.\n\nWith neutrinos its even weirder, but I'm getting pretty far off point.",Physics

This term is, in fact, hard to calculate and depends on things that we can't yet probe. But it doesn't matter because there's another contribution from GR. This one is an integration constant. That is, it is a free parameter not predicted by anything. So the observed number is the number from QFT plus the number from GR. You can see that it doesn't matter what the QFT number is since you can get to any possible observed number by changing the number from GR to match.\n\nNow someone familiar with this topic knows that I have swept a big elephant under the rug. The numbers in question are a bit silly. The number from QFT seems to be something in the range of 10^120 times the measured value. So the GR number has to be 1-10^120 in the same units. Now, there's no problem with it being negative, but some physicists are surprised that these two seemingly unconnected areas of physics have two numbers that are so closely related.

"It‚Äôs call the [Oberth Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect)\n\nOne way to look at it, the unburned fuel going at higher speeds has more energy than fuel at rest.  If the rocket is going faster then the fuel can provide more energy.  When burned, the fuel exhaust has less energy coming from a rocket that is moving quickly than it would at rest (since you subtract the rocket‚Äôs velocity from the rest exhaust velocity to get the actual exhaust velocity).  When a rocket is moving quickly, the rocket is extracting more kinetic energy from the fuel than it does at rest (as seen from an outside observer).\n\nKeep in mind that chemical energy rockets do not follow F=ma, and their acceleration is not constant nor proportional to their instantaneous mass (the actual equation is F = m * dV/dt + dm/dt * V, though if the fuel mass flow is small compared to the rocket mass, F=ma is pretty dang close).",Physics

"Hello, I'm kinda stressing out about choosing to major in chemistry or some biological science.  \nA little background:  \nI am currently a sophomore in college. I entered as a computer science major. I have done really well so far, currently having a 3.97 GPA. Over this past year, my Grandfather entered hospice care. I have been taking care of him at night and in the mornings. I help him go to the bathroom and make sure he is clean. I give him baths and help administer medicine. I guess I'm trying to say I enjoy taking care of him. I feel drawn to the healthcare field now and I no longer really love computer science. I used to code for fun(make apps/build websites) but haven't felt the urge or desire to attempt any new projects. Looking out 5/10 years from now I don't really see myself being happy with software development even if there is a lot of money to be made. I think I want to become a doctor. I have always had a heart for taking care of people and I think becoming a doctor would be incredibly rewarding.  \nAnyways, I decided to take gen chem and biology as electives alongside my CS courses this semester to see if I could major in one of them. I am doing well in both of them right now with A's. I enjoy both courses but was wondering which one would be a better fit for me. Biology seems to involve a lot more memorization but also looks at how larger systems work. This is somewhat similar to CS problem solving in that it breaks complex systems into smaller ones that are more easily manageable. My chem course has more problem solving and math. I'm not the biggest fan of memorizing info even though I am pretty good at it. I enjoy math and breaking a problem down into more logical steps. I would rather work on 20 calculus problems for a couple of hours than review notecards for a couple of hours. I was wondering at the higher levels which major would suit my learning style better.  \n   \nIf anyone could help me out I would appreciate It. I apologize for any grammar/writing errors. I have never been too good at writing. Thanks again.",Chemistry

"Not my expertise but no one's answered yet. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, please.\n\nAnyways, to answer, I'm seeing 2 alternatives to the cubic unit cell. The tetrahedron and a hexagonal thing. The hexagonal thing is not the simplest unit so it's pretty easy to see why that's not the unit cell. The tetrahedron I actually only see in your description and I'm reasonably certain the reason it doesn't work is that it does not contain enough information or atoms to rebuild the crystal structure. I'm actually not really seeing a tetrahedron. The best tetrahedron I can see is not regular by any stretch of the imagination and definitely won't tesselate to rebuild an entire crystal from that unit. Did you mean octahedron to include all the face centered atoms in the cubic crystal? The issue there is that if you tesselate the object, you'll skip a bunch of atoms. \n\nThe short answer would be that very smart people have worked on this for over a century and the cube is the simplest unit cell that can be tessellated to reproduce the entire crystal structure. If you have an alternate idea for the unit cell, I guarantee your missing something. You either will skip certain atoms when you tessellate, can't tessellate it at all, or you could create an alternate and simpler unit cell that will also work.",Chemistry

"let's call the time on the ship t' and the time on earth t. the conversion between the two times (the time dilation) is given by something called the ""Lorentz factor:""\n\n  \nt'= Œ≥t  \n  \nwhere this ""Lorentz factor"" Œ≥ = 1 / ‚àö1-Œ≤¬≤  \n  \nŒ≤ is speed, but as a percentage of the speed of light   \n(so if you were going 100,000 m/s, Œ≤ = 100,000/3√ó10\^8 = 3.33√ó10\^-4)  \n  \nThis looks super random, but trust me it makes sense. You can see from this why you have to be going super fast to get any time dilation: small Œ≤ means the denominator is about 1, meaning the whole Lorentz factor is about 1. In the example above, the time on the ship t' would be about 1.000000056 times the time on the ground (so they are virtually identical) .  \n  \nThings start to pick up the fast you go though. If you were going at 99% the speed of light (Œ≤=.99), then you can plug into the equation above and find Œ≥ is about 7. You could see this from two perspectives: in the frame of the spaceship, the earth time is passing seven times as fast; or in the frame of the earth, the time on the spaceship is passing seven times as slow. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in your example: if 2.5 million years have passed in the frame of the earth, then a person in a spaceship going at 99% the speed of light would perceive that time as being about 357,000 years instead.",Physics

"As I learned from Carl Sagan, we can't comprehend 4D, but we can calculate it's ""shadow."" \n\nFor example, a creature in Flat Land that can only experience 2 dimensions will not be able to comprehend a cube, BUT, it CAN comprehend the SHADOW of the cube as projected onto its 2D world. From the creature's point of view, the object is not a collection of equal sides and angles, like a cube is supposed to be, but rather, the creature sees two differently sized squares linked together (just like a drawing of a cube).  \n\nLike the creature, we cannot see or comprehend a cube in the 4th dimension, but we can comprehend its shadow as projected onto our 3D world. A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience. You're right in that we can calculate these 4th dimensional objects and possibly insert them into a virtual reality code, but all we would be able to see are the ""shadows"" of the objects, like the 3D representation of a tesseract.\n\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/55433/in-what-sense-is-a-tesseract-shown-4-dimensional",Physics

"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics

"I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.",Physics

Bottle experiments (like this one, which measure neutrons that **do not** decay) measure a lifetime about 10 s less than beam experiments (which measure neutrons that **do** decay). This could be due to experimental error, or a 1% branching ratio to some exotic decay channel. This result doesn‚Äôt help resolve this puzzle.\n\nImproved precision helps probe CKM unitarity. Also, the neutron lifetime is an important parameter in Big Bang nucleosynthesis because it determines the ratio of protons to neutrons prior to the beginning of formation of heavier nuclei.\n\nThe neutron source is rad hot. We use a 800 MeV proton beam to produce spallation neutrons, and then cool them to UCN energy levels. Solid D2 is used in the final step to downscatter cold neutrons to ultracold neutrons. This all happens under a shield stack of concrete and steel.",Physics

">The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn‚Äôt affect the energy required to capture it at all.\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.   \n\nWhether any and all of this is done by burning fossil fuels (to generate the problem) and running renewably powered CO2-harvesters (to fix it) such as the prototype in Iceland, OR by decomposing plant and animal matter over thousands of years (the problem) and growing plants and algae (the fix) -- regardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back.  Whether this is done by just letting the winds blow over your adsorbant for 100 000 years, or by the flora growing for a 10 000, or by some array of turbines circling the planet and run by solar power for a thousand --- doesn't matter at all.  The fact remains that to reverse an irreversible process, you'll be spending at least the same amount of energy (and in practice, usually, much, much more). \n\nThere are many things that go into that confidence, understanding of the laws of thermodynamic being one, the ""sadly"" minute concentration of CO2 another (it would be much, much easier to process the N2 of our atmosphere, for example) -- we can even get to those if you like, but we simply *must* get around the *same* table before its even worthwhile.  As of now, you've written walls, I've said things, but we haven't been even discussing the same thing really.  \n\n\nI will read the rest of your comment, too :)",Physics

If this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôre saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I‚Äôm aware, I don‚Äôt think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don‚Äôt know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn‚Äôt be using fossil fuels for energy. I‚Äôm not a ‚Äúclean coal‚Äù or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It‚Äôs not a fixed cost for every material. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren‚Äôt trying to ‚Äúunburn the coal.‚Äù Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn‚Äôt coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I don‚Äôt think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.",Physics

"The force holding the cars up is friction. Any object traveling in a circle is accelerating towards the center of the circle, so the car is pressed into the wall (it would fly off in a straight line if the wall disappeared, and each point on the wall ahead of the car is slightly closer to the center of the circle relative to the trajectory of the car at any point, so the car is constantly pushed towards the center as it moves forward). The pressure into the wall creates static friction with the wheels (point of contact of a moving tire is stationary) which provides an upwards force against gravity. The wall is also slanted, so the wall itself provides some force upward on the car due to gravity, adding even more to the friction force.  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/forces-newtons-laws/inclined-planes-friction/v/static-and-kinetic-friction-example  \n\n\nhttps://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/centripetal-force-and-gravitation/centripetal-forces/a/what-is-centripetal-force",Physics

"For comparison, we could look to beta plus decay. A free proton will never decay because such a process is energetically banned, but bound inside a nucleus, this becomes possible because the energy situation has changed (the mass of the daughter nucleus is less than that of the mother, since nuclear mass is a complex function of number of protons and neutrons). So, similar idea here. The energy conditions strongly suppress or outright ban neutron decay in the star, which can also happen for various nuclei. I don't know my neutron star physics, so I can't comment on how exactly the process is suppressed--your explanation intuitively makes sense though.",Physics
