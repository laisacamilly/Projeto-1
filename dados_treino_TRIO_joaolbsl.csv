"From my experience, high school chem is nothing like uni chem. Sure they teach you about bonds and elemental properties, but it's mostly oversimplified basics (which is harder to understand than if they explained in detail) and wet noodle you can live without. If you want to find out the best way is to find actual course material online. Here is an [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qTCy2wTL_s&list=PL2902385153144A26&index=10) I found on youtube that looks similar to my first lectures at uni. Find some interesting topics and see if you can follow. I am biased but the first year really isn't rocket science. It's more about whether or not you enjoy learning about it or not. Physical chemistry is cool but I don't really care about it. But I completed the courses and about to go into pharma (if all goes well) so it's whatever. You just continue to find interesting stuff to keep you motivated to learn the things you don't like.",Chemistry

"There are two main components of drag for vessels on a liquid: wave drag and viscous drag; viscous drag is the drag one would think of in aerodynamics, the act of the trying to push through the viscosity of a fluid. Wave drag is the force felt by “riding the waves” of the liquid, the force that allows surfers to surf along with a wave. Ducks minimize viscous drag by having hydrophobic feathers and ducklings can naturally be propelled towards their mother by “riding” the wake of her motion on top of the water. In still water total drag would be in the opposite direction of motion but the mother is supplying a wake which allows the ducklings to get in a formation where each are “riding” the wave and passing it back to their siblings to ride too, propelling them all forward, this would be an example of “negative” total drag aka >100% drag reduction.",Physics

"No, the amount of kinetic energy injected by shaking a bottle is negligible compared to the amount of energy it takes to heat its contents by a few degrees.\n\nThe heat capacity of liquid water is about 4.2 Joules per gram per Kelvin. Half a litre of water weighs about half a kilogram, so heating up a bottle of water by one degree takes about 2 kilojoules. At that kinetic energy, your bottle of water would be travelling at 300 km/h or 200 mph. This is all assuming no net energy loss of course.\n\nA quick google actually found that someone answered [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1zw2xp/will_shaking_a_bottle_of_water_heat_it_up/cfxwxlk/) before: shaking a well-insulated bottle for about 10 hours will heat up its contents around 50 degrees centigrade.

"I’m in the UK, so things are a little different, but the same principles apply (and I’ve met students from a range of countries). In my professional life, I spent a lot of my time supporting students who were in the same place as you are now, so I can appreciate your concerns.\n\nStudying at University is a big change from school, so you may well find University challenging initially. That’s completely normal. You say you study hard, and I’m sure you do, but perhaps you need to rethink <how> you study. Do you just read through stuff repeatedly? Do you work through practice examples? If you have to do tests, do you work through practice tests? If you have to do essays, do you do practice essays? If you read through stuff, don’t just read it. It’s better to make lists of the main points that the book / website / resource is making, for example. That will help fix it in your memory and identify areas you’re not sure of - you can return to those later.\n\nI’d expect performance to improve as students progress from year to year, because they become more experienced in studying - in other words, their ‘study skills’ improve. In the UK, most universities would run study skills sessions for students, particularly in their first year: I don’t know if sessions like that are available in your institution. If there are, it might be helpful if you took part. How approachable are your tutors? It might also be worth speaking with them and asking their advice.\n\nA very big change to your programme of study needs careful consideration. I suggest you don’t make a switch unless you are VERY sure you want to do it, and can make a list - you might want to type it out - of reasons why it’s a good idea, and why you will ‘cope’ better in that new area.",Biology

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics

"When you're body has built up an immunity to a virus, certain immune cells have developed proteins which can recognise the same viral antigens so they can quickly start destroying the virus.

"It’s call the [Oberth Effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect)\n\nOne way to look at it, the unburned fuel going at higher speeds has more energy than fuel at rest.  If the rocket is going faster then the fuel can provide more energy.  When burned, the fuel exhaust has less energy coming from a rocket that is moving quickly than it would at rest (since you subtract the rocket’s velocity from the rest exhaust velocity to get the actual exhaust velocity).  When a rocket is moving quickly, the rocket is extracting more kinetic energy from the fuel than it does at rest (as seen from an outside observer).\n\nKeep in mind that chemical energy rockets do not follow F=ma, and their acceleration is not constant nor proportional to their instantaneous mass (the actual equation is F = m * dV/dt + dm/dt * V, though if the fuel mass flow is small compared to the rocket mass, F=ma is pretty dang close).",Physics

Few people really considered the many ways that we now have benefitted from knowing more about how it works.\n\nThe fact that there were more fundamental explanations unifying magnetism with electricity and light and (separately) spacetime gives us hope that there may be something more fundamental, a theory of everything, that could impact our technology and lives similarly in the future.

Your current skills will be just so much more valuable.  90% of the time that is all I'm reading and the remainder is filler content.  YMMV.\n\nYour PhD experience will be the majority at maybe 1/2 - 2/3 page in length of both bullet points and short 3 line length project summaries.  The PhD experience is so huge that you can realistically omit all other job history and nobody will say anything.\n\nShould you feel you must include it or show a longer working period, a customer service job is maybe just 1-2 lines of year/location/title.  Different if are specifically targeting a job in customer service + chemical industry.  A chemical sales job I'd go 3-5 lines because working for a chemical company is relevant, especially the product, type of chemistry, size of team, your ops budget and any successes.  I do have jobs where I want to see evidence the chemist has a broad knowledge of supplier networks, but I also have jobs where I would ignore that skill.\n\nAnother aim is to remove any *negatives* from a resume.

And while the Earth's field is weaker at any given point, it's much, much larger, so even relatively powerful magnetic fields become imperceptible after a few tens of meters. The diameter of the Earth's outer core (where it generates its magnetic field) is 7000km, while the LHC's beam pipes are only 40cm wide at most. And magnets are dipoles, so their field falloff tends towards being inverse cubed, so they get harder and harder to detect once you move away from the source.",Physics

"I think we've converged on most points.\n\nFor the last one, neutrinos have mass. This is well established at many many sigma. There is good agreement in the so-called solar parameters between solar oscillations measured by SNO, Borexino, SuperK, and others with long-baseline reactor measurements by KamLand. The former measurement will improve considerably with DUNE and the latter with JUNO. The so-called atmospheric parameters show even more impressive agreement with atmospheric measurements by SuperK and IceCube, long-baseline accelerator measurements by MINOS, NOvA, and T2K, and medium baseline reactor measurements by Daya Bay and RENO. This paints a clear picture that neutrinos oscillate which guarantees that at least two of them have mass.\n\nWhat does that mass look like from a model building point of view? The fact that there are lots of options is exactly why neutrinos represent the biggest open questions in particle physics. They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term from a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs field, same as the rest of the fermions. This guarantees at least two new gauge singles (i.e. right handed sterile neutrinos). The story is obviously more complicated than that since we don't know if lepton number is a good symmetry. If it is not, then there is also a Majorana mass term with, presumably, additional fermionic gauge singlets.\n\nOf course model builders have developed many more interesting models to give neutrinos mass, some of which don't include right handed neutrinos, but they do all include several additional particles anyway.",Physics

During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.",Physics

"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air’s volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate’s downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air’s acceleration along the escape path. The air’s inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate’s downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it’s on a more pronounced “air cushion” but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air’s pressure to remain high. Now that the plate’s weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it “slides downhill” on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate’s slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics

A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube.

It occurs after conjugation in some organisms, but conjugation is not necessary for plasmogamy, most organisms release spores or gametes into the environment therefore conjugation is mostly not required.\nKaryogamy is the fusion of the nucleus. In some organism karyogamy is quite delayed after plasmogamy such as in certain kinds of fungi.\nI hope this helps, you will get a much clearer idea of these if you choose to take biology in higher classes.

That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nIt's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution.

"So it sounds like your less confused about why it's exothermic and more confused about how a metastable system can change phase exothermically. But the thermodynamics doesn't care. Thermodynamics only states how energy will change eventually, there's absolutely no timeline on that change. In other words, thermodynamics states that when the solution crystallizes, it will be exothermic by X amount. That could happen immediately if you cool it too fast and don't achieve that metastable state, or it could happen the moment you give a metastable state a nucleation site. That energy is coming from all the interactions formed and lost (lost interactions with water, gained bonds between ions, in this case), so that energy comes only comes into play when it actually crystallizes. \n\nI'm not going to explain why crystallizing sodium acetate is exothermic here.

Is general intelligence simply the average of one's different types of intelligence? I feel like intelligence may be impossible to quantify with the limited information that we can gather about someone. For example, Nickola Tesla was an ""intelligent"" individual but he was also delusional and had problems forming relationships which suggests that he had a low emotional intelligence. Therefore I would say Tesla was in fact of average intelligence, even though he was a very noteworthy individual who advanced various fields of science. Perhaps intelligence can be defined by one's contributions to society, but even that leaves a lot to be desired. Can anyone recommend a book about what intelligence actually is? Because I'd be very interested in other's thoughts on the subject.",Biology

">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",Physics

"The same set of nine essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) are common to all animals, as far I know. In other words, sometime after a heterotrophic lifestyles developed in the pre-Cambrian, key enzymes in those metabolic pathways were lost, probably when our ancestors were single celled protists. Once those critters started eating other critters, there was no selection to conserve those chains of enzymes in the metabolic pathways.\n\nHumans can still synthesize the other proteinogenic amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, tyrosine) from other metabolic precursors, though perhaps not at levels ideal for human health. [Glycine](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/033/05/0771-0780) is of some interest here.\n\n\> Does the body know the difference\n\nYes. Some amino acids serve important signaling functions. For example, the most common essential amino acid, leucine, plays a key role in satiety and in telling individual cells whether they should adopt a anabolic (make stuff) or catabolic (recycle trash) tone. In both cases this is via the remarkable metabolic regulator [MTOR](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=mtor&as_occt=title) (mammalian target of rapamycin).\n\n\> Are these then stored or flushed through the lymphatic, on to elimination systems?\n\nNope. Each individual cell largely is its own factory, responsible for grabbing what it needs from the bloodstream, and discarding what it doesn't via bloodstream. Excess amino acids get excreted via the kidneys.\n\n\> Any good books on the subject?\n\nI have a batchelor's in biochemistry, so I'm not deterred by the jargon, but learned almost nothing about nutrition in my school days. For those with a scientific background like yourself, I'd recommend academic textbooks, like [Modern nutrition in health and disease](https://1lib.us/book/3484357/f6767f). For those without a scientific background, I haven't encountered good overviews of basic metabolism. The best I've seen for general audiences are the books by Michael Greger, M.D. like *How Not to Die* and *How Not to Diet*. These won't offer much detail on how nutrients are absorbed and disposed of, but may be of use in dispelling common myths and learning to eat a healthier diet.",Biology

"Why do you eat? Why do you need minerals like calcium and iron? Why do you need proteins?\n\nBecause you are literally made of what you eat (and breathe and drink). The water in your body comes from the water you drink. The calcium in your bones and iron in your blood comes from the iron and calcium you eat. Etc etc etc etc. And the same thing goes for plants and bacteria and every other living thing. And when living things reproduce, it's the same thing.

"O2 slowly going up when the blower is off is fairly normal. All boxes have a nonzero leak rate, but the catalyst can handle it as long as the air is circulating through it.

I had a very similar problem in grad school. The issue turned out to be a problem in the regeneration line - the exhaust solenoid had an obstruction, and so it was always open. As a result oxygen could sneak in through the exhaust line and into the catalyst, but would only be able to get into the box and the sensors when air was circulating through the catalyst.

"If by expired you just mean outlasts its sell-by or use-by date, but is still sealed up inside the bottle or can, then probably not much. If the seal is still good and no air can get in, then there won't be much decomposition in most cases.\n\nThe exceptions will be certain wines or beers which still contain some live yeasts - you can tell which ones these are because there will be some visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\n\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\n\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as ""mother of vinegar"". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\n\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it. This may subsequently grow mould, but it would be useless long before it got that far.",Chemistry

Under normal circumstances, the bike will stand up right. As soon as other factors are added such as wind or a weight, the bike will be pulled down and the wheels cannot compensate for this entirely. A component of the force will pull the bike to the direction of the force. In order to not fall down, you will angle the bike such that this component is zero again, thereby moving the bike in the opposite direction. You will always balance the bike, it's just that with an extra force to the left side you need to balance by moving the force from the weight to the right hand side.",Physics

But they are a consequence of the simple fact that polymerase doesn’t stop when it runs into sequence ahead of it.

"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell. Sounds counter intuitive, but that's just because writing it out in words introduces imprecisions.",Physics

However, to explain further. \n\nBecause it’s a constant angle, the amount of light contained within that cone is constant, so if you’re really far away from the source, the surface containing all that light is super spread out. At every individual point, the intensity is indeed lower due to 1/r² laws, and your eyes aren’t big enough to catch all that light, but in the entire steradian, the amount of light remains constant, hence the intensity per steradian, is constant.",Physics

"Yes, you are measuring things.  Two differing reference frames, time, and The speed of the bullet in those reference frames, For starters.\n\nHow they get ""synced together"" (not a good phrase, but I'm going with it) isn't by doubling the speed of the bullet.  It is by using a Lorentz Transformation.  When the above posters talk about blue shifted light coming from the bullet this is related.  Due to the nature space-time warping at relativistic speeds the energies involved become a hindrance thus creating a cost for objects of mass in typical space-time system where they can't reach c.  As it creates an asymptotic energy cost to reach c.  Leaving us with a situation where it would look to the observer always less than c.  \n\nSo the observer would see, as you correctly said, the bullet travel from the gun to them in 10 seconds.  \n\nBut\n\nThe bullet would take a different time, differing reference frames and all that.  \n\nSo how do we rectify the two?  Which is where I think your question lies.  \n\nEvery time step (1 sec) light or some bit of information leaves the bullet AT the speed of light and reaches the observer.  It will always reach them first.  So, for the entire trip light is signaling the arrival of the bullet before the bullet in the bullets reference frame to the observer in the observers reference frame.  And since the bullet only goes 0.5c (and none faster) those bits of photons going c tell us the bullet never went c, regardless of how we experienced it.  \n\nLuckily we have blue shift and other measurements to tell us this rather accurately.  Because if we see, hear, feel, the bullet we have measured it.",Physics

"I can’t necessarily debunk it. I think it’s a bit hasty to dismiss all homosexual behavior though as a confused instinct or something. Surely we can never really know an animal’s motivation behind an instance of a specific behavior; maybe they are asserting dominance or maybe they’re experiencing same-sex desire—who can definitively say?\n\nAll in all, I find the arguments about homosexuality being natural or unnatural because of animal behavior to be unnecessary. Naturalness doesn’t necessarily mean something is good or bad. And anyway, why couldn’t it theoretically be “natural” for the human species and no other? I just think it’s all kind of a fruitless argument, kind of like how when people debate abortion they spend all this time going back and forth about when “life” begins.\n\nIn the end, for human homosexuality, I think all we need to know is that a significant portion of our population experiences same-sex desire at some point in their life, maybe their entire life. Whether it’s natural or genetic or “a choice” isn’t really important. What’s important, in my opinion, is who gets to decide what human behaviors are acceptable and to what end? \n\nPersonally I want to live in a world where human sexuality is only limited by the absence of consent and the age of the people involved. Maybe other people feel differently, that’s fine. But we should all be asking who benefits and who suffers from their particular agenda.

And basically none of the descriptions really sink in. The problem, of course, is that it is a fundamentally QM process with no classical analog. So it's better to at least use the right words so people can connect what they're reading here with what they've read and heard elsewhere.

These can pass via breast milk to your baby and induce the same inflammatory reactions in your child’s body.\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people are also talking about passing antibodies via breast milk. This can occur, but only IgA antibodies. IgA is secreted in our mucosal surfaces to neutralize incoming pathogens in our mouths, lungs, GI tract, etc. However, vaccines predominantly cause an IgM and IgG response.

"It depends on the depth to which you want to dive. \n\nTo give the basic gestalt: \n\nLight enters through the air into your cornea, through the pupil and onto the retina surface of the eye. \n\nTwo types of receptors in retinal tissue, called rods and cones, sense the light and convert them into physiological electricity in the form of an action potential. \n\nThese action potentials travel through fibers that travel back to the brain via the optic nerve. \n\nDepending on the location within the eye orbit, the fibers have a different pathway to the brain. \n\nThe fibers located in the retina on the side of your nose cross over just after entering the skull, at the optic chiasm. \n\nThis allows the left side of your vision to be stored on the right side of your brain, and your right side vision to be on the left side of the brain.  (the brain has a thing for crossing over like this).\n\nFrom here, the fibers travel to the thalamus, which further divides them by where they originated in the retina. \n\nFrom the thalamus, the fibers travel to specific parts of the occipital cortex, depending on whether they originated in the superior part of retina, or the inferior part of the retina. \n\nThese fibers travel to distinct locations in the occipital cortex. \n\nThe brain processes these impulses and produces your perception of your surroundings. \n\nObviously, great amounts of time can be explaining the nuances of vision.",Biology

I think your definition of free will is insufficient.\n\nIn AI and economics there is the concept of an agent with goals. A rational agent acts to achieve some goal (win the chess game, get the car to the destination) by choosing actions, or sequences of actions, based on their perceived utility towards achieving that goal. Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\n\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations. I think the search for ""free will"" ultimately demands a distinction without a difference and uninteresting compared to studying biology, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.\n\nThis is a very liberal arts degree take (as my psychology and sociology education ends at the 200 level in the New York state undergraduate system), but I like Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development as a starting point for modeling and qualifying different types of actors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development\n\nHe distinguishes the person (often as stages of life from infancy to adulthood) who only makes choices to avoid negative stimuli (punishment, hunger), with a person who acts toward some perception of right and wrong, and from there distinguishes where they get their sense of right and wrong-- does their friend group or society dictate their morals or do they have their own moral system that they would listen to over the rules society provides.\n\nIt's very simplistic and self contradictory. Like Heath Ledger's Joker could be argued to be level 2 like a pleasure seeking child as well as he could be argued to be a transcendent level 6 with his own higher moral code.

"Actually, u/Adventurous_Yam_2852 is correct. Giving testosterone (T) as part of transgender transition from female to male is *very* different from giving T to adult cis males to alter voice. \n\nThe first one raises T from very low (female normal) to high (male normal), similarly to the change in puberty, while the second would be a much smaller increase (if at safe levels). So, the proper comparison with trying to lower voices of cis male adults with more T would be trying to *further* lower voices of trans men *after* their transition -- something known not to either work or be safe.\n\nGiving a large T increase to adult cis males to lower voices might work (I don't know but doubt it), but would definitely carry important long-term health risks including high cardiovascular health risks, blood pressure increase, certain types of feminization (as the body tries to rebalance by increasing estrogen), testicular atrophy and more.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

"Welcome to this puzzling problem set\n\nI am currently doing a reaction in the lab, where I am working with a molecule that contains the moiety shown above.\n\nUpon treatment with base (Carbonate Buffer at ph 9 and 10 as well as in DMF with DIPEA) there are peaks/masses appearing on the LCMS and also it seems like the cleavage of the Thioester just stagnates after a certain point.\n\nIt took me a while to develop ideas what byproducts these masses on the LCMS could belong to\n\n**a:** shows the molecule before treatment with base. This mass also appears after treatment with base which I find quite confusing because I would expect the thioester to be completely broken up\n\n**b:** shows the molecule upon treatment: the thioester is cleaved and the thiol is freed (I also see the mass of the disulfide of b)\n\n**c:** shows the mass of my product without the acetyl-protecting group on the amine. This is something I find super surprising – why should the acetyl be cleaved off? It's an amide, so…super stable? I know what you are about to say: maybe it's just something that happens in the LCMS through ionization! 1. there was an extra peak for this mass in the UV and molecule e also kinda proves that c really exists.  \nAlso, I expect **c** to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (**shown in d**). They do have the same mass\n\n**e** would be the disulfide formed between the free Thiol of b and d. Upon addition of TCEP to the mixture this mass vanished. This would also prove the S-N acyl shift theory\n\nSo:  1. why is there deacetylation happening in the first place?\n\nAnd here comes the biggest question mark: I have 3 substrates, they all look quite similar to a except they don’t have an acetyl-protected amine (they don't have an amine close to this position at all). Still, they all show these weird rearrangement (or whatever) masses. This would speak for another part of the molecule participating in these side reactions. (the structures drawn above are just interpretations of the masses based on the original molecule)\n\nDo you have any other suggestions about what could happen? Is there another shift I don’t know of between Amides and thioesters? Could the secondary Amine participate in this reaction (because the secondary amine is also present in every substrate)\n\nI am very confused by the outcome of this reaction and any ideas or suggestions would be very appreciated!",Chemistry

"You make some fair points, but I’m a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we won’t be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isn’t what you’re saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I’m aware, I don’t think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don’t know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn’t be using fossil fuels for energy. I’m not a “clean coal” or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It’s not a fixed cost for every material. I can’t tell if I’m missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren’t trying to “unburn the coal.” Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn’t coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I don’t think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.",Physics

Reminds them of 💩,Biology
"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology

"I often see posts like this,\n\nThere is a lot of anxiety in people about ""chemicals"". Be it lead in tinned food, cyanide in almonds, passive smoke vapour from cigarettes. The lists of ""health hazards"" is practically limitless. But ""hazard"" is a sliding scale. You can technically die of a cyanide overdose from eating almonds (you'd have to eat astronomical amounts). There are cases of people overdosing on bananas (potassium has radioactive isotopes). What I'm getting at is there are things you should worry about, and things you shouldn't. And this is firmly in the ""don't need to worry about"" category.\n\nMuch bigger health concerns: smoking, drinking, obesity, diabetes, lack of exercise. \n\nNow this may be a totally innocent ""rabbit hole"" you've gone down. But this also very common in people who go on to develop more severe stress / anxiety about chemicals in the world around us. If you are feeling yourself becoming anxious when thinking about chemicals, please look into chemophobia and the call to nature fallacy.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemophobia\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature\n\nThis wiki article is a good place to start. \n\nNow onto your specific issue with lead:\n\nYes, lead can bio accumulate. Yes, noone has found any health benefits to having lead in your diet. Have you ever met someone who's got lead poisoning from eating food and living a normal lifestyle? Almost certainly not. That's because governing bodies put regulations on how much lead contamination can be present in food. \n\nThat means someone, somewhere has worked out limits for exposures/doses to limit bio accumulation in humans. (In fact, many people work on this and other regulations). Even if there is not formal ""safe"" level, there is somewhere a ""practically safe"" level, where the concentration is low enough that we don't see health side effects in a normal populace. (Again, exact values may be unknown or disputed. Consider that lead has been around for 4000 ish years, and most cases of lead poisoning are either acute exposure, or from long term profession related exposure (eg, people working with lead paints)\n\nFor example, in the 1980s lead limits for tinned food were 4x higher (0.4 ppm Vs 0.1) than they are today, and even then, actual cases of chronic lead poisoning back then were low. Because they were sealing tin cans with lead solder. That no longer happens.\n\nI think my TLDR is: please ignore if this was an innocent ""rabbit hole"" question. If not, and you find yourself becoming anxious, I strongly advise you find online resources for chemistry, so you have a better understanding of things like concentration, doses, etc. There are tonnes of resources out there.\n\nThanks for taking time to read this!",Chemistry

"Pressure building up in the bottle as the air inside it warms up. This is a fundamental behaviour of all materials. It’s especially pronounced in gasses and fluids since their molecules aren’t stuck together like solids.\n\nWe can express this as the ideal gas law\n\n(Pressure) x (Volume of container) = (amount of gas) x (Conversion ratio) x (Temperature). \n\nSince the amount of air isn’t changing, and the volume of container isn’t either, change to temperature has a directly proportional effect on the pressure of the bottle.\n\nEventually the pressure overcomes the weight of the lid, and latch.\n\nIt then equalizes pressure, gas leaves the system, and the lid falls, closing.\n\nActually similar to how the coolant in your car engine gets distributed. There is a flow regulator they call a thermostat that as it gets warmer it expands and lets through more coolant starting at some designated temp. If it gets cool it provides less coolant. It’s a self regulating system, and how your car engine always stays at the same temp once it’s heated up.",Physics

Frequency is the most precise unit we can presently measure, so running out of experimental digits to agree with might not be the issue in this case.\n\nSince gravitation is responsible for this altered timing, GR can make a prediction for this alteration, and indeed according to the article apparently it does so well.

"Even LIGO ""raw data"" is the basis of an enormous amount of modelling of the experimental apparatus, and as it is impractical for you to build another one, and the events that they measured are one-time events, you are still trusting them to an enormous degree that all of their sophisticated lasers and signal processing works the way that they claim it does.

"It really depends on the laws of your country. In a couple of countries (the Netherlands, Portugal, Czech republic, Switzerland) is not illegal to consume any kind of methamphetamine for personal use, regardless on the reason why you are using it. But usually at least some methylamphetamines are categorized as controlled substances and altough consumption might not be per se illegal, possession and sale surely are. There are also several methamphetamines which are perfectly legal in almost all countries and which you can buy in any pharmacy as OTC pharmaceuticals; e.g. levo-methamphetamine and d-pseudoephedrine, but those ones are not really psychoactive so you are not going to get any of the desired effects by smoking them. And returning to your ""science project"", as others have said, only participants can take the drug, not the ones testing its effects. If you want to volunteer as a subject in any clinical trial involving a particular methamphetamine you can surely apply and if you're lucky you are gonna get to use the drug, but I still find unlikely that they will let you smoke crystals of methamphetamine hydrochloride, as other routes of administration are far more likely (for example orally or intravenously).

">I don't know that we have an urgent need for specific terminology to discuss alien life. Life outside of Earth is completely hypothetical. If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt is for something I plan to work on, but life outside of Earth is 100% fact, we cant argue against that.\n\n>It's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\n>If, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So ""tree of life"" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life).\n\nMy point is that humans dont share a common ancestor, we evolved from ourselves, but we have two forms, our ancestors (Very similar to primates, but not decended to them) and our pre ancestors ( our old form, in our old planet, we would have to scrap many things to presume How we lived and were, my hyphotesis is that we behaved like robotic psychics, we were telepaths, used the Power of our minds to do tasks and processses, constantly changing our environment. We probably didnt have emotions, didnt move, were giants, like towers, and I dont even know if we did procreate).\n\nAnd I even claim that our pre ancestor side is regenerating with time, this is why we dont look like animals anymore and became more rational.\n\n\nTaxonomy is a actually something much more complicated, in some cases, like us, you have to show the multiple Nature while maybe at the same time showing their percentages, it should be something like chemistry, where the nomenclatures are all complex and sophisticated.",Biology

"There is a hell of a lot more to the electron transport chain than just powering PSI, but I'm guessing for a highschool(?) Level question that would suffice.\n\nA little more depth though...PSI can actually be activated by light in the far-red wavelengths which exist in natural sunlight. The movement of electrons and breaking of water molecules across the electron transport chain is actually useful in a number of different activities such as ATP production, dissipating and storing solar energy to prevent damage (this is a main feature of photosystems, turning energy into sugars and starches by powering the calvin cycle). ATP is produced as a product through excess hydrogen from spiltting water being pushed out of the membrane through a concentration gradiant to produce ATP using ATP synthase. \n\nYour question is answered in the first section, but I could go on and on about the electron transport chain.

"Yes, not all quantum phenomena lend themselves easily to a wave analogy, but weak values are another example of spooky action at a distance. Which itself is also made much less weird if you're ok with matter as waves. Of course a wave could affect things far from its most concentrated point, since it is inherently a delocalized object. \n\nAnd I appreciated, in a fuzzy way, how my intuition on matter breaks down when once I go subatomic. But I'm not talking about *really* understanding matter; I'm talking about making basic concepts and experiments in quantum mechanics almost completely unapproachable for laypeople by continually starting from the particle perspective. \n\nThe Cheshire Cat effect is awesome though. My work is in understanding and predicting chemical behavior based on subtle, long distance effects through the electron charge density that are more significant than convention tells us.

"The 2021 Ig Nobel prize may have been remote, but it wasn’t remotely the least interesting. There were a plethora of interesting scientific works in the prizes \[1\]. Particularly interesting for me was the prize for physics and kinetic, which were related.  These prizes were for attempting to understand how human crowds self-organize.\n\nThe physics prize \[2\] looked at modeling human crowds and showed that by tracking actual human interactions that we can be described quite well with simple long-range (sight) and short-range interaction terms. Using this fluid dynamics approach they showed good agreement in describing real interactions. The same group previously attempted to direct pedestrians but was not very successful \[3\], suggesting we still need to develop how to introduce external forces.\n\nThe kinetics prize \[4\] was given for investigating the effect of people on phones in crowds. No shocker here, they are the worst and slow everyone down. But it is still important to understand how this happens if we wish to potentially minimize the effects.\n\nIf you prefer to read some popular science articles on these topics youcan check out these from phys.org \[5,6\]\n\n\[1\] [www.improbable.com](http://www.improbable.com)\n\n\[2\] [www.journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.062310](https://www.journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.98.062310)\n\n\[3\] [www.collective-dynamics.eu/index.php/cod/article/view/A34](https://www.collective-dynamics.eu/index.php/cod/article/view/A34)\n\n\[4\] [www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe7758](http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abe7758)\n\n\[5\] [www.phys.org/news/2018-12-pedestrians-cm-comfort-zone-collisions.html](https://www.phys.org/news/2018-12-pedestrians-cm-comfort-zone-collisions.html)\n\n\[6\] [www.phys.org/news/2021-03-distracted-pedestrians-people.html](https://www.phys.org/news/2021-03-distracted-pedestrians-people.html)",Physics

"Yep, you are missing another part of the story! Correct, the macronutrients are digested into the monomer units and absorbed into the bloodstream. However, the other part of the story is metabolism. Metabolism is highly complex and involves many molecular conversions to produce various molecules the body might need at any one instance.  \n\nA scenario where glucose might be converted to fat is eating food when your body already has sufficient energy. If the body has sufficient energy, there is no reason to break it down further to produce energy. Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \n\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores. For creation of fat stores, glucose is converted into triglycerides (basically fat) and it is stored as fat in your body.",Biology

[https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MariaPereyra.shtml](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MariaPereyra.shtml) Gives us the slowest speed of a shotgun slug at about 335 m/s, and if we are goint to take the .2s reaction time from the first article as our standard, that means we need to be about 67m away to have any time at all to move, and we need to add on the amount of time (and therefore distance) we need to actually do the moving. A 12 gauge shotgun slug is about 18mm accross so let's say that's how far you need to move your hand to not get hit. How long does it take someone to move their hand 18mms? I have no idea and no clue how I'd find that out, but I'd bet it's not very long. Let's call it a tenth of a second, not including reaction time. So that gives us a range of about 99m. All of this is assuming, of course, that you only notice the shot when it just leaves the barrel. It doesn't take into account the tiny bits of time it takes for a trigger pull to translate into a hammer strike, and the travel down the barrel, which would give you more time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if someone shoots at the edge of your body, with a slow shotgun slug, from across a football field, yeah probably. Looking it up some, a 12 gauge is still accurate at that range, but with a significantly decreased amount of force, so your dodge is probably helpful, if you pick the right direction.",Biology

"> I can build my resume according to apply for graduate school for my PhD\n\nYou don't really need to target a grad school application that deeply.\n\nMost grad schools simply rank applicants based on GPA from high to low.  Reason: almost all grads have the same relevant skills - practically none.  \n\nA PhD is a learning role - you are expected to learn and become an expert.  What's the best predictor that someone is good at learning chemistry from a chemistry professor? ... good grades in the classes taught by that professor.\n\nNobody is taking a GPA 3.2 student with hands-on lab experience over a GPA 3.8 student with only basic lab class experience.  I can teach you lab experience in a few weeks but I can't teach you to do the work.\n\nThere are some easy in's to skip the queue but most applicants won't have those.  For instance, a research publication, working for a friend of a friend of the professor, a boss who knows the new professor and then personally calling up the new one to ask them to take you on.\n\n> What challenges might I still have to overcome\n\nAvoid sob stories - focus on positive stories.

"There’s an interesting neutron lifetime “puzzle”, where different types of experiments measure different values for the lifetime. Bottle experiments (like this one, which measure neutrons that **do not** decay) measure a lifetime about 10 s less than beam experiments (which measure neutrons that **do** decay). This could be due to experimental error, or a 1% branching ratio to some exotic decay channel. This result doesn’t help resolve this puzzle.\n\nImproved precision helps probe CKM unitarity. Also, the neutron lifetime is an important parameter in Big Bang nucleosynthesis because it determines the ratio of protons to neutrons prior to the beginning of formation of heavier nuclei.\n\nThe neutron source is rad hot. We use a 800 MeV proton beam to produce spallation neutrons, and then cool them to UCN energy levels. Solid D2 is used in the final step to downscatter cold neutrons to ultracold neutrons.

"Social Empathy: The Art of Understanding Others\n-by Elizabeth Segal \n\nI read this one for an English class of all things. It is IMO the definitive breakdown of the what why and how of empathy. I just did a term search for IQ, intelligence/intelligent, smart, cognitive. The only one that showed up in any significant way was cognitive because empathy is a cognitive process. But there’s nothing specifically related to intelligence. I would say that self-awareness is it’s own type of intelligence but I don’t think that’s what you’re asking. So based on this researcher’s findings, I think the answer to your question is no. There is not a correlation between intelligence and empathy.",Biology
"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.",Chemistry

"The main problem is how we make them. We can make an atom or two at a time in a particle accelerator of basically all the super heavies, it's how we discovered basically all of them. We can also make macroscopic quantities up to Es or Fm in high neutron flux reactors (ie the HFIR at Oak Ridge). We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a µg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-µg scales.

"I agree with most of what you said up there, though the effects of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere and the temperature of the planet were known as early as the second decade of the 20th century. And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change.

Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive.

When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes.

"It’s unlikely we could have powered the initial industrial growth via renewable energy, and for the first 100 or so years we didn’t even have that much concern about human emissions causing the planet to warm. Obviously there were still serious issues associated with pollution and also the exploitation of workers and regions that produced oil. \n\nThat said, most of the historical emissions have been after sometime around 1950-1980 when people were already starting to worry about the impact of emissions on the earth’s temperature. In this sense, it is true that we chose to emit greenhouse gases over renewables because of a desire for growth and profit. I’m not sure how developed renewables were at the time, and clearly they were under developed because of a reliance on oil, but renewable energy and battery technology likely weren’t able to replace oil in the 70s or 80s because of how big of a head start oil had. If you look at solar, for example, NREL shows that IBM had one in the 1975 with around 22% efficiency, but the price in the 70s was way higher than it is now to the point where they couldn’t have replaced oil. It also wasn’t merely a profit thing because the high price is associated with a difficulty in manufacturing it in bulk. \n\nAll this aside, you don’t make a compelling case for why we shouldn’t try to capture CO2. Yes, we could have used renewables in the past to avoid CO2 emissions, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to capture CO2 with plants powered by renewables. Direct air capture from the atmosphere followed by sequestration is one of the few ways that we can reduce the CO2 that already has been emitted. Yes, we can use trees or other natural carbon capturing systems, but carbon capture materials can also play an important role in reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions. \n\nOne important issue with carbon capture and sequestration is that it is incredibly unprofitable (unlike what you said). You spend money capturing something from the atmosphere that is useful (you can burn it to generate energy) and then just bury it underground. You allude to how people want to profiteer off of carbon capture, and I agree with you related to things like capturing carbon from either a coal or natural gas plant and then burning it (this is currently done actually), or capturing it from the atmosphere and then burning it, but the only way carbon capture and sequestration would make you money would be if there were government incentives like a carbon tax or by the government just funding the operation of carbon capture plants.",Physics

"I’m sorry. I don’t think you are considering the thermodynamics relevant to the situation. \n\nI don’t know what you mean by “filtering the atmosphere to get to the adsorption part.” The adsorption of CO2 is the same thing as the filtering. The point is to have an adsorbent that is selective for CO2 over other atmospheric gases. \n\nHere are two examples explaining why I don’t think your analysis is correct. First, rather than direct air capture people are working on capturing CO2 from a coal or natural gas flue stream. As mentioned in my previous comment, a coal plant will produce a good deal more CO2 than a natural gas plant will for the same amount of energy generated, but this actually doesn’t matter so much for the point I’m trying to make besides making it likely that you would want a different adsorbent material for the the two cases. If what you’re saying is correct, this work would be a completely pointless endeavor. In order to capture the CO2 from the fossil fuel plants, you would have to generate as much energy as they are generating with renewables. There would be no reason to do this if you were correct, yet this is a very active area of research that gets funding from the DOE and other sources. This is more of “proof by authority” than actually addressing your point with a physical argument, but I mention this because it’s one of the main reasons that I initially was skeptical of your claim. There are likely many hundreds or thousands of scientists currently working on, evaluating, and funding this type of research that your apparently simple argument based on the second law of thermodynamics renders pointless. It seems unlikely to me that so many people just haven’t considered this claim, especially since process modeling on the economic and materials cost of these materials is common as well and in that type of modeling, they develop sophisticated thermodynamic and kinetic models of CO2 capture in specific materials. They wouldn’t continue doing this if it were as simple as just having to input as much energy as you initially got out since then it would be a pointless task. \n\nThe second example is one I alluded to in my previous comment. Suppose in one case that all of our historical emissions were from coal plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_c. Suppose in another case that all of our emissions were from natural gas plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_n. In both cases there would be the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but E_n > E_c since natural gas emits less CO2 than coal for the same amount of energy generated.  By your argument, in these two scenarios, we would have to generate different amounts of energy to capture this carbon dioxide. This doesn’t make sense, however. Once the carbon dioxide is in the air, it doesn’t matter how it got there. We aren’t trying to turn the CO2 back into coal or back into natural gas. Instead we are trying to get it to bind to some material, and the energy required to make the material and unbind the CO2 later (if that’s required for storing it underground) will be fixed for the same material capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, regardless of the source of the CO2 initially. The material doesn’t care if the CO2 came from coal or a fire or from a person breathing. \n\nTo address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. After absorbing light it doesn’t permanently stay in an excited state. \n\nYour fart example misses the point again. The point of carbon capture isn’t to end up with coal or natural gas or whatever else as a byproduct of CO2 capture. The point is going from coal -> CO2 (and other things) -> CO2 bound to some material. It isn’t trying to make something a reversible process.",Physics

You act like those are not terrible numbers, but they are.\n\nFor really useful QC calculations, we're going to need about 1e9 of them with fidelities considerably better than 99.99%.  A lot of that has to do with magic-state distillation for doing required operations on error-corrected qubits.  At 1.6 us, that is going to take about 1500 seconds per calculation, assuming you can even build a system that large with ions, which (with today's technology) you can't.\n\nI am consistently astonished by the poor quality of ion-qubit apologists' understanding of the field.",Physics

"Why would this be a process you attempt in situ? You're telling me you'll design an entirely new nuclear reactor based entirely on the idea that it might maybe form something somewhat beneficial? I mean, you're talking about introducing a fuel rod, a reflector and a gas  into a reactor. Just with fuel rod and reflector, you would at a minimum need to completely overhaul a reactor to swap it out to your newly designed fuel rod and reflector. Plus you'd need to introduce a gas stream into the system which gets very complicated. Cooling efficiency would change dramatically... so... I really don't see any other option than complete redesign. I'm also not sure what you're doing about cladding. Every fuel rod I know of is encased in a cladding material that would prevent the formation of the uranium nitride you want since that uranium is not exposed to the NH3. I'm willing to bet that a basic solution is not ideal for the system, either. \n\nI don't know the decay chains of everything so I'll just take your word that a neutron will create 15-N. Presumably that will be most efficient at a certain neutron velocity so why wouldn't you take a nitrogen source to something like a spallation neutron source or just another reactor (there's a few designed as neutron sources) where you can convert it to 15-N with significantly higher efficiency? Plus then you're designing a reactor around a known advancement rather than around something that might maybe create that advancement.",Chemistry

If someone is hell bent on fabricating data they can get away with it and it has of course happened, but like I said earlier it comes to light sooner or later because any result that is important enough to matter will be attempted by other people as well.\n\nThere is a recent trend that all data should be made available publicly though. For the paper I'm writing at the moment it will be uploaded somewhere, because one of the funding agencies for the project state in their terms that the data should be made public. It would avoid situations like this, at the same time it will be a few TB of raw data sitting somewhere that will likely never be looked at by anyone else.",Physics

"This is wrong, as has been mentioned elsewhere.\n\nWe know a ton about DM and it is not a placeholder for anything. We know how much of it there was at the point of last scattering due to precision measurements of the CMB's temperature temperature correlation (as well as from polarization information). We also know how much there was due to measurements of the abundances of light elements. It is because these two measurements agree that we *really* believe that DM is what we think it is. But we also know its radial profile in galaxies, that it doesn't interact with regular matter much, that it doesn't interact with itself much, that it clumps, that this clumpiness dictates the large scale structure of the universe, and probably other things that I'm forgetting. All of these things point to a self consistent picture of a cold fluid that has thermally evolved like matter and has been present in corresponding densities since the very early universe.\n\nA lot of non-physicists have this idea that DM is just rotation curves and nothing else. That is *not* why we believe DM exists, although it is one more data set that points to a consistent picture, and it is the first data set pointing towards DM, but far from the most precise.\n\nAs for DE, it is also not a placeholder. We see that we have recently (a few billion years ago) entered into a DE dominated era where the evolution of the Hubble parameter is increasingly dominated by DE. The primary data set for this is type 1a SNe. While this data set is tricky, there are a large number of independent checks of DE, notably intrinsic curvature. In addition, we have looked for higher order moments in the acceleration of the universe and not found any, suggesting that DE is what we think it is. Finally, we know that the equation of state of DE is close to -1 as expected from the cosmological constant.\n\nWhat is going on right now in these areas? Many things. For DM, people are using the open data from experiments like GAIA to detect substructures in the galactic DM halo, which is mind boggilingly awesome. As for DE, with upcoming experiments like Vera Rubin we will increase our SNe data set by orders of magnitude.\n\nFinally, the dark sector mentioned in this article isn't the same as dark energy or dark matter, although it could be. Despite the fact that these names all sound related and very vague - dark sector, dark matter, dark energy - they are distinct things. The article is about neutrinos and an anomaly at 4.8sig that just got weirder: obvious explanations don't work so people are turning to less obvious things. This is the way discoveries work. Something strange happens in the data (MiniBooNE sees an excess), the simplest interpretation is investigated (a sterile neutrino), so follow up experiments are built to robustly test this. MicroBooNE just reported their first test of MiniBooNE's excess and, in a different kind of experiment, they don't see it. But the MiniBooNE result has been checked to hell and back, it is pretty hard to believe that it is just an experimental problem, although it could be. Thus people are considering new physics scenarios other than sterile neutrinos and these scenarios often go under the umbrella term of dark sector, although it's a pretty shit name just like dark matter and dark energy.",Physics

A crank asking for the data is just useless noise and a distraction and, for that matter, so is this discussion.\n\nIf some rule forces scientists to deal with cranks without advancing the actual discovery of scientific truth, the rule is in this case not a positive one. The net contribution of Hirsch to the study of superconductivity is *negative.* A rule which allows him to badger any experimentalist in the field is a bad one.\n\nThis is independent of whether Dias completely made up his results or not: Hirsch is not going to provide any insight into that, and it's not possible for us to decide it either. It's going to be other actual experimentalists working with materials like this who will either succeed or fail to reproduce the behavior.\n\n> . I’d be much more convinced about CSH if they’d refute the issues he brought up instead of ignore them.

You can't just say the right magic words and stun Hirsch into silence with the power of data. \n\nAnd you can't ""sink him"": I think his reputation is probably as low as can be in the actual community of active researchers.

"Everything is a carcinogen. Our own body produces carcinogens by creating ATP. It’s a question of exposing your body to something that damages your DNA faster than your body can make repairs. There are some things, like asbestos, where even just one fiber can cause cancer, but most things, it’s how much you’re exposed to. Peanut butter, for instance, is a carcinogen but 40 tablespoons of peanut butter has the same cancer risk as a single cigarette. And it’s all risk, there isn’t a guarantee that anything will for sure cause cancer. But a single drop of nail polish on your bedsheet is really not enough of a cancer risk to even blink at. But something else that’s important is that being stressed a lot is a bigger health issue than spilling nail polish. If you are worried that you will damage your relationship with your family by telling them you spilled a little nail polish- you need a professional therapist to help you with your anxiety. A therapist is an awesome person to have in your life, they help you direct your thoughts so that you’re not so burdened by your anxiety.",Biology

">Hmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off\n\nmRNA is used for translation. It's the very basic central dogma of molecular biology.\n\n>I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body.\n\nEvery step of the way of translation to post translational protein modification can be modulated. I don't think the issue is with excessive expression of the mRNA, honestly. Right from the beginning, i ruled out mRNA because of the weak responses and thought that the more traditional vaccines would be more effective in a pandemic. The mRNA technology tends to yield weak response (or so i thought) and requires more doses/longer periods of time.

Now, yes there are a lot of specific nuances to this idea, but that's what research is for, right? Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of ""tolerance"" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen. Probably much easier said than done, but hey, it's an idea.",Biology

"1.The fact that he's young and healthy doesn't necessarily mean COVID won't hit him hard. Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \n\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to ""enter every cell of the body"" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more ""leaky"" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these ""infected"" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and ""diluted"" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \n\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly. It just mimicks what happens in any other viral infection. Your friend's argument is sooo general it's annoying. If he told you a suggested mechanism of action of this, then we can discuss. But like this? He should provide a source with a proof of that. \n\n4. Some people already answered. I don't really know the history of mRNA vaccine clinical trials so I won't say much. But let's not forget some companies didn't manage to make good mRNA vaccines for COVID (and tried), and that a lot of money and effort from thousands of scientist went to make these vaccines work. That for sure played a part in this success. \n\n5. I really don't like anegdotal evidence. What does it mean he ""measured""? Did this doctor actually designed a study and properly measured a correlation between a vaccination and all these diseases? And published it? If not, then his words don't mean anything.",Biology

"From Wikipedia:\n\nIn general, glycerophospholipids use a ""sn"" notation, which stands for stereospecific numbering.[5] When the letters ""sn"" appear in the nomenclature, by convention the hydroxyl group of the second carbon of glycerol (2-sn) is on the left on a Fischer projection. The numbering follows the one of Fischer's projections, being 1-sn the carbon at the top and 3-sn the one at the bottom.\n\nThe advantage of this particular notation is that the spatial configuration (D or L) of the glycero-molecule is determined intuitively by the residues on the positions sn-1 and sn-3.\n\nFor example sn-glycero-3-phosphoric acid and sn-glycero-1-phosphoric acid are enantiomers.\n\nMost vegetable oils have unsaturated fatty acids in the sn-2 position, with saturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or 3-sn position.[5] Animal fats more often have saturated fatty acids in the 2-sn, with unsaturated fatty acids in the 1-sn and/or sn3 position.[5]",Chemistry

There's a couple of characteristics of a good catalyst IMO.\n\nSelectivity is one. Meaning it does the desired transformation 99% of the time or more. Imagine doing a reaction an the kilotonne scale. Lower selectivity means more waste and a 1% drop there is a lot of waste.\n\nTurnover number is another. How many molecules of reactant are converted to product in a second? Catalase is the one that comes to mind as the best here.\n\nStability is the last one that I'd consider. How long can the catalyst perform before it becomes inactive? Sometimes the catalyst can be regenerated like zeolites but you still want to be able to either stay in an active state or be stable enough to regenerate from an inactive state.,Chemistry

"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology

"I started off in biological engineering, which took 4 years, but during that time I took physics classes for fun because like you I found them more interesting.

This isn't typical; I'm a workaholic, and people tend to take at least 6 for a phd.\n\nSo all said from zero degrees to 4 took me 9 years.

"Within the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons are part of a group of particles called leptons, which also includes the electron's heavier brothers the muon and the tauon, and their respective neutrinos. Electrons differ from muons and tauons only in mass: their charge and other fundamental properties are exactly the same.\n\nWe expect that the muon, being a heavier lepton, will decay into an electron over time, as will the tauon, which can decay into a muon or an electron. Importantly however, the Standard Model predicts that the decay rate from a tauon to an electron should be the same as the decay rate from a muon to an electron, up to a factor of their masses. As all the other properties between muons and tauons are the same, only their *mass* can affect the decay rate. This is called *lepton universality*, and it basically means that leptons only differ from each other in their mass, and interactions cannot depend on their flavor.\n\nA test of lepton universality is to take very heavy mesons, like the B meson (which contains a bottom quark), and observe its decay. B mesons will decay into K mesons by having their bottom quark decay into a strange quark, and this decay is mediated by the weak force, which allows coupling to leptons. Lepton universality then allows us to predict how many muons vs tauons we expect to see when these decays happen, and a couple of years ago we found a 2-3σ deviation from the theory, suggesting that lepton universality is not correct. This deviation was not large enough however to warrant a claim of ""new physics"" having been observed, for that we would need a >5σ detection.\n\nThe new results from LHCb repeat this 2-3σ deviation. It's consistent, but still not sufficient for new physics.",Physics

"A decent chunk of it is angular momentum. When things spin they resist any change in their vector (more or less), or an acceleration. This is my guns are rifled. The bullet spins and it has a straighter trajectory. It is angular momentum that keeps a bicycle upright. This is really simplified, but I think it gets the point across.\n\nCheck out this video that shows how the path of a football changes with spin: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMD1tJI9AWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMD1tJI9AWE)\n\nWhat you have stumbled upon is that the reason gyroscopes work is because of their angular momentum. There is an experiment/demonstration with a spinning bicycle wheel ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaauRiRX4do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaauRiRX4do)). When the wheel is spinning trying to change its direction creates a Newton's 3rd Law force pair. If you do this experiment on an office chair you can actually spin yourself around just be trying to tilt the wheel ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cRb0xvPJ2M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cRb0xvPJ2M)).\n\nRealistically, it's a bit more complex than that (ie spinning changes the aerodynamics), but I think this gives you an idea of the physics behind it and should lead you into some further investigation.",Physics
