"Try coating chemist. Application specialist (but u might get lot of IT hits, filter thru). Try formulation chemist \n\nBut as others said, your resume might not be the best quality.  Your university shoukd have career placement service. Have few different advisors review it.  Call those staffing companies, I used Kelly service 10 years ago.  Tell them you are seeking job in chemistry and if someone can give feedback on your resume. The staffing companies goal is to find you a job that way they can pocket 30% of your salary.  Your goal is to get feedback from them & worse case get yourself in the door at the cost of giving part of your salary.  Then find a place on your own",Chemistry

"Typically, no. Depending on how peer review goes, a reviewer \*might\* request dana and analysis scripts, etc..., but I have never encountered that. Having reviewers analyze raw data would make an already inefficient process less efficient. Data analysis can involve loading and manipulating a collection of opaquely named files with uncommented scripts. \n\nThe aim of peer review is not to search for fraud (although it can and does sometimes catch  this), but to evaluate a paper on scientific merit (e.g. is it correct? is it novel? etc...). Trust still plays a large role in peer review. \n\nUsually, a journal will require an author to agree to a 'data availability' statement, which says the author agrees to provide the data \*upon reasonable request\* (or something to that effect).",Physics

"The following is my personal opinion as a student of physics, i base it only on reason, might be wrong.\n\nMuch less so than gas.\n\nGases expand into whatever container is holding them, practically averaging out the amount of particles per cubed centimeter. Liquids tend to compress and expand much less because theyre bound together better than gas.\n\nAir moving over a wing will decompress as it makes its journey longer than the journey of air underneath the wing. This fast, decompressed air pulls the winged object upwards, right? Water wont ""give"" in the same way, as i said most liquids are resistent to compression and decompression. I would say the shape of the wing will definitely alter the object's trajectory, but the mechanics behind it are different from in a gas, and i wouldnt call it ""lift"".",Physics

"Without realistic waste recycling it is a non-starter.\n\nWe made a fundamental mistake in the 1950s. We ran military reactors at Oak Ridge and Hanford to produce plutonium for weapons. This eliminated the incentive to recycle waste from commercial reactors. That led to the unsustainable policy of storing waste on-site.\n\nFrance, Russia and the Uk recycle spent fuel rods greatly reducing yhw waste which needs to be stored and extending the life of the fuel.\n\nWe could adopt the French system which is less susceptible to catastrophe like Fukushima or  Chernobyl or Three Mile Island.\n\nWe could go over to thorium reactors but that would involve total retooling of the Industry. \n\nNone of this will happen because there is too much private capital at risk.

Pepper spray is usually made of a mixture of ethanol and capsaicin. Capsaicin isn’t really flammable but ethanol is.

"Not possible, and getting close is incredibly super niche, as in maybe <5 people in the world.\n\nMost neuroscience researchers will be MD qualified, or psychologists.  They just don't need the skills of a chemist for neuroscience or neurochemical studies.\n\nThe chemicals they do put in the brain they simply just purchase from the synthetic chemistry folk.  There are maybe 3 groups that have a synthetic chemist on staff, but those people aren't making new molecules - they are making familiar molecules on demand such as radio-labelled tracer molecules.\n\nYour niche with chemistry would be acting as a shopfront for the neuroscientists.\n\nOne possible niche is related to what I do - making materials to act as brain implants.  It's really difficult to find chemicals/materials that survice in the human body and still do what you intend.  Even more difficult to find any material that survives while acting as a tube to the outside world.  Medical devices and sensors are a trendy research area right now.  For instance, the Cochlear ear implant has a lot of different materials.  All of those needed to be designed, tested, modified over time.  You need to know about electronics, inorganics, organics, polymers, biochemistry, surface studies, anatomy, cellular biology, biomedical engineering, etc.  It's incredibly multi-disciplinary.",Chemistry

"Like everything in chemistry,[ there are many different types of ""shock sensitivity""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_sensitivity) and at least 4 competing test methods.  \n\nFor instance, *shock* from a pressure wave, *impact* from striking with a hammer or *friction* of opening a container, sometimes you see static discharge included too.  These are different.\n\nThe oldest test is simply hit it with a hammer.  If the hammer is thrown into the ceiling, it's a shock sensitive material /joke.\n\nThe shock sensitivity of an impact detonation is called a ""gap test"".  Put a known mass of material in a metal cylinder.  Drop a heavy metal weight onto it.  Start at a low drop height, moving the weight higher and higher until the material detonates.  The smaller the gap, the more shock sensitive.\n\nPractically there is a low threshold point where you stop measuring.  There is no point determining which is baddest, it's all bad. \n\nBoth TATP and nitroglycerin have BAM friction score <5N and impact gap tests of ~5 cm (so very very low result = highly sensitive).  Effectively both are off the scales for sensitivity.\n\n> more prone to accidental detonation\n\nUser error has more influence than material properties.",Chemistry

"Welcome to this puzzling problem set  \nI am currently doing a reaction in the lab, where I am working with a molecule that contains the moiety shown above.  \nUpon treatment with base (Carbonate Buffer at ph 9 and 10 as well as in DMF with DIPEA) there are peaks/masses appearing on the LCMS and also it seems like the cleavage of the Thioester just stagnates after a certain point because first the peak starts decreasing and then it just remains...which is weird because I would expect the Thioester to be fully degraded) \n\n   \n**b:** shows the molecule upon treatment: the thioester is cleaved and the thiol is freed (I also see the mass of the disulfide of b)\n\n  \n**c:** shows the mass of my product without the acetyl-protecting group on the amine. This is something I find super surprising – why should the acetyl be cleaved off? It's an amide, so…super stable? Also, I expect c to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (shown in d). They do have the same mass   \n**e** would be the disulfide formed between the free Thiol of **b** and **d**. Upon addition of TCEP to the mixture, this mass vanished. This would also prove the S-N acyl shift theory   \n  \n**So:  1. why is there a deacetylation happening in the first place?**\n\n2. Is there maybe another shift I don’t know of between Amides and thioesters?\n\n  \n  \nAnd here comes the biggest question mark: I have 3 substrates, they all look quite similar to **a** except they don’t have an acetyl-protected amine (they don't have an Amine *in this position* at all, so actually it would be counterintuitive that these byproducts happen because of an S-N Acylshift because there is no N close to the S in the other molecules). Still, they all show these weird masses.   \nDo you have any other suggestions about what could happen?   \nCould the secondary Amine (the one next to the phenyl) participate in this reaction (because this secondary amine is also present in all of the three substrates)   \nI am very confused by the outcome of this reaction and any ideas or suggestions would be very appreciated!",Chemistry

"NO3-N is Nitrate as Nitrogen and this is the public drinking water standard for reporting Nitrates in drinking water as of 2016, at least in California. The Action Level (AL) is 10 mg/L, whereas an action must be taken to mitigate the nitrates in your water at this level or above. Prior to 2016 nitrates were reported Nitrate as NO3, where the AL was 40 mg/L. Therefore they are different measurements of Nitrates and for public drinking water reporting you must report NO3-N.

Oil floats on water. Mercury sinks below water. If you filled a balloon with oil and threw it into a pool the balloon would be no different thag a helium balloon in the atmosphere. \nI think the question you’re actually asking is can a liquid float in air? Not that I know of. You can get into some weird situations like hyper dense gasses like hexaflouride. Helium 3 is the least dense liquid but I think it only exits around absolute zero and at that temp hexaflouride would probably freeze solid. If you had a frozen glass of helium 3 it would “float” on hexaflouride until the helium evaporated. \n\nUnder high pressure I would guess it’s possible a liquid metal could float on some freak gas but that’s high level chemistry.,Physics

"To be clear, I have no issues with the concept that neutrinos oscillate. I could quibble with some of the picks you made about which experiments to mention where, but it's unrelated to why I'm interested in the strong statement you made about that meaning that there's ""almost certainly sterile neutrinos""\n\nI think you're pretty clearly a theorist. I doubt that even a phenomenologist would say something as bold as:\n\n>They almost certainly have a Dirac mass term\n\nBut assuming you're talking to an idiot (we accept ""experimentalists"" as a demonym), why should I believe that your right-handed neutrino exists?

"Within the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons are part of a group of particles called leptons, which also includes the electron's heavier brothers the muon and the tauon, and their respective neutrinos. Electrons differ from muons and tauons only in mass: their charge and other fundamental properties are exactly the same.\n\nWe expect that the muon, being a heavier lepton, will decay into an electron over time, as will the tauon, which can decay into a muon or an electron. Importantly however, the Standard Model predicts that the decay rate from a tauon to an electron should be the same as the decay rate from a muon to an electron, up to a factor of their masses. As all the other properties between muons and tauons are the same, only their *mass* can affect the decay rate. This is called *lepton universality*, and it basically means that leptons only differ from each other in their mass, and interactions cannot depend on their flavor.\n\nA test of lepton universality is to take very heavy mesons, like the B meson (which contains a bottom quark), and observe its decay. B mesons will decay into K mesons by having their bottom quark decay into a strange quark, and this decay is mediated by the weak force, which allows coupling to leptons. Lepton universality then allows us to predict how many muons vs tauons we expect to see when these decays happen, and a couple of years ago we found a 2-3σ deviation from the theory, suggesting that lepton universality is not correct. This deviation was not large enough however to warrant a claim of ""new physics"" having been observed, for that we would need a >5σ detection.\n\nThe new results from LHCb repeat this 2-3σ deviation. It's consistent, but still not sufficient for new physics.",Physics
"I worked on this experiment. AMA\n\nBoron-10 has a high capture cross section for neutrons, and the cross section increases as 1/v. The neutrons in this experiment are ""ultacold neutrons"" (E < a few hundred neV) so 10B has a very high capture cross section. The capture reaction is 10B (n,alpha) 7Li.\n\nThe detector is built like a sandwich. On the outer edges are ~20 nm of 10B. The interior layer is ZnS, a scintillator. In the middle there is acrylic that has wavelength-shifting fibers (WLSF) built into it. From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs. This allows for us to look for coincident signals between two PMTs, which significantly suppresses (and more importantly, stabilizes!) background noise from ~250 Hz to ~0.5 Hz.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

"Could you elaborate more on your second law of thermodynamics claim? And also more broadly why you think the energy required to capture carbon must be greater than or equal to the energy we gained from it initially. After looking more into it, I’m a little more skeptical. \n\nYou can see here (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=73&t=11) that different sources produce different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same amount of energy produced. When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2, there will be a fixed energy cost. It won’t vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process. All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced. Like I said before, carbon capture isn’t trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process. The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted. In fact, when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent, it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound, so that energy will be released in the form of heat. This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind, depending on the way CO2 binds to the material. \n\nIn this type of adsorbing set up, the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2. The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned. The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials, and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies.",Physics

This lead trapped inside the SiO2 or B if you have borosilicate doesn't come out of the lattice as easily, because to the best of my knowledge it replaces a Si atom. Although, depending on the pH of what you consume you might leach some Pb into your meal, so I would say it all depends.

And, yes, hydrocarbons have been awesome for rocketing humanity into the 21st century. But we aren't changing today. We know. We know what is happening to our planet, the science is solid and incontrovertible. And yet, our carbon production is growing every year. This year is more than last year, and that was more than the year before, and so on. Saying that we can use renewables to capture carbon in the future sounds great. But it ignores the fact that we are not using renewables to replace carbon producing energy industries today. This is a diffusion of focus. Articles like this (including that awesome Icelandic carbon capture machine that was profiled so ubiquitously a month ago) are distracting us from our immediate need. We must reduce our carbon production today. There is no other (top) priority, and every one of these 'science will fix it' distractions only reduce the impetus for change. This is doubly true when you look at the minutiae of these schemes. The energy required to remove carbon from the atmosphere is more than the energy gain from putting it in there. I wonder sometimes if articles like this aren't mostly posted by the paid corporate trolls of the carbon producing energy companies.

"Disagree. I'm not a knee-jerk anti-nuclear wingnut, but given the dramatic progress in intermittent renewables over the past decade, the use-case for nuclear is substantially smaller than many redditors seem to think it is. There's certainly a good case to be made for nuclear power for clean load-following or baseload electricity generation, but that's about it. My experience is mostly limited to American energy policy, but there's not much reason to believe other countries would have it substantially better when even the French nuclear industry is broadly declining.\n\nDue to the numerous safety regulations governing nuclear power plant construction, upkeep, and decommissioning (which, for the record, I think are a good thing), nuclear power plants are expensive as hell and take forever to build. kWh for kWh, they simply cannot compete economically with cheap silicon PV. Even if they could, a primarily nuclear energy industry would require new power plants being finished across the country every few days just to keep up with the rate at which they'd be decommissioned. Given how long they take to build, it's easy to see that the modern American nuclear industry is literally multiple orders of magnitude away from providing more than ancillary support to a broader green energy economy, powered primarily by solar and wind.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a universe where investment in nuclear energy deployment continued apace for the past few decades, laying the foundation for a zero-carbon nuclear future.

"Neutrons decay by emitting a Beta particle (electron) and a neutrino and end up as a proton (there’s a bit more that happens under the hood with quarks, but from the outside looking in this is the end product).  As a free particle, a neutron has more energy than a proton, electron, and neutrino combined.  This means that the neutron will tend to go to a lower energy state by changing into a proton.\n\nIn a nucleus, a neutron has the same potential energy as before, but now there are other positive particles nearby - protons.  To turn into a proton while surrounded by protons requires energy: the same energy as bringing a proton to the nucleus from infinitely far.  In stable nuclei, this requires more energy than would be released by the neutron during decay.  Therefore the event is exceptionally rare or practically never happens.  It’s as if the surrounding protons are gatekeeping the neutron and not allowing it to decay.\n\nIn some larger nuclei, where there are a lot of neutrons relative to protons, there aren’t as many protons to repel the potential new proton and more surrounding neutrons with favorable binding energy through the strong nuclear force.  These nuclei do have neutrons decay into protons through beta decay.",Physics

Then once it meets the edge of where there is less to no other gasses in the atmosphere it has to just push against gravity now and right there it glides right into space with ease.

"to be honest I dont agree. Using gloves only when they are necessary is more advisable I think (of course you need to know when you need them and learning to be aware of possible dangers is worth a lot). A lot of stuff in the lab, especially teaching labs, is not more dangerous than stuff that is commonly used at home, it is important to differentiate. Also if people wear gloves they tend to care a lot less if they spill something or not and if they do, they contaminate everything instead of cleaning the mess up immediately. Wearing gloves for a prolonged amount of time also causes sweating and opens the pores, which makes the exposure to chemicals even more dangerous and guess what, gloves also have a time limit on how long they guarantee to withstand different chemicals and people also tend to not care about that and wear gloves for hours.\n\nOf course I dont want to abolish gloves, but I think brainless overuse causes more harm, than it does good.

"I don't know much about them, but what I meant by wasted is I'm pretty sure the thermal conductivity would go as followed: N-15 doped uranium nitride > uranium nitride > uranium dioxide. Nitrogen-15 has one of the lowest thermal neutron capture cross sections of all stable isotopes. Therefore, less energy input would be used in maintaining the neutron flux in comparison to UO2 based fuel rods. \n\nInstead of neutrons being captured by only U-238, U-235 and / or Pu-239 to trigger nuclear fission they're also being captured by oxygen-16 or nitrogen-14 and creating carbon-14 as a byproduct. Using nitrogen-15 doped uranium nitride would be more energy efficient. \n\nI mean at least to my understanding, it's a bit too much information for me to take in all at once in order to fill in the gaps of my knowledge of how nuclear reactors work in a couple hours.",Chemistry

From the object's point of view, something happened that caused him to emit sunlight back at the sun, meaning you can calculate what light it must have shone onto it that caused it to emit sunlight (sunlight + what it should absorb).

In this case, 77.1 \* 9.8 \* the height of 5 stairs. This quantity is equal to the kinetic energy Johnny has gained by the time he reaches the bottom, which is equal to 1/2\*m\*v\^2. Since you know his mass, 77.1 kilograms, you can solve for his final velocity to determine his momentum upon hitting the ground - which is found by multiplying his mass by his final velocity. The force he experiences upon hitting the ground depends on the time it takes him to come to a full stop. That's because Johnny's change in momentum, which again is mass times velocity, is equal to the impulse he receives from the ground, which is force times time. Therefore, a more drawn out or cushioned impact results in a smaller force.",Physics
"Think about the forces in play. You have a constant air resistance force applying itself horizontally to the rope. You have tension in the rope that is not constant. If we pick two points on the rope and imagine the tension we see the tension is much higher at the top as the rope is holding the mass of all the rope beneath it. If we look at a point at the bottom, the mass of rope applying tension is much less. Again, if we look at the forces applied to a single point on the rope we can see at the top the tension vector is very long in the negative direction in comparison to the horizontal force of the wind. The sum of those vectors faces almost completely down. As we continue to do so further down the rope we see the tension decreases and the ratio of that tension vector in comparison to the horizontal air force vector decreases and the total force vector points more in the direction of the horizontal force.",Physics

Cold neutrons travel around 2200 m/s, or roughly 7e-6 c (c is the speed of light). Ultracold neutrons are much slower, so we can approximate them as stationary.\n\nAt 7e-6 c time dilation is a 2.5e-11 effect, which is **much** smaller than the 1e-2 effect that we are trying to understand. Anything other than time dilation wouldn't work as an explanation.

Any decay must be allowed in the boosted frame in order to be allowed in the lab frame.",Physics

"In quantum field theory (which we know to work pretty damn well), in principle there are certain processes that are allowed to happen. Those processes are called ""Charge-Parity symmetry violating"". There's one parameter (called Θ) in our equations that determines how frequent those processes should occur, and this is something we have to measure experimentally and cannot derive theoretically, just like the masses of particles, their charges or how strong certain interactions are.\n\nAnd we experimentally find that those processes...have never occured once since we started looking for them in the 70's. So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Θ is zero. We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\n\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.",Physics

"Disclaimer: You are taking the very first steps of a very long road thrilled by many physicists, many of them never accepted Quantum Mecanics as a physical theory.\n\nYour thought experiment were in fact already executed several times and in different situations. There are a lot of underlying conditions you may be missing, I will give you some food for thought:\n1) Under Quantum Mechanics formalism (QM), energy conservation is not to be understood in the same way you may have under Classical Mechanics. The most striking example of this is the tunneling of particles through a potential greater than its total mechanical energy. But this is not the only one. See the Casimir force, for example;\n2) In your setup, you are probably taking your 'detectors' as perfect ones, which never miss any detection and does not give false positive. Even in a thought experiment, it is hard to conciliate this with QM formalism. Either way, supposing you have one, you are entering the 'spooky action at distance'. See the debate between Einstein and Bohr on this subject, where Einstein states what was later known as EPR paradox. I consider this a very important criticism because - although Einstein were proved wrong at the end, its questioning gave rise to a whole new field of QM, known as the QM contextuality. The first concise steps in this new field were given by Bell, which stated his famous 'inequality', I suggest you to have a try on this too;\n3) The true answer to your question is: the speed at which this 'information of detection' should travel is not relevant. What is known is that it happens as long as you adquire information about the system, you have your 'colapse'. Also, it does not violate classical energy conservation, because in the long run, i.e., in the limit where you have a long enough number of trials, total energy will be conserved. If you search for the arguments and references I've mentioned in step 2, you will inevitably end in the so called 'Hidden Variables Theory', which is in fact the begining of the contextuality problem.",Physics

"Well that's what I'm asking. Under the right conditions can nitrogen-14 accept a neutron to become nitrogen-15 without losing the proton and becoming carbon-14? Nitrogen-14 captures neutrons that uranium-238 could be capturing to become fissile plutonium-239 after undergoing beta-decay, leading to decreased efficiency. \n\nBut actually that's precisely why it'd be inefficient if nitrogen-15 could be made by neutron capture in a reactor. The more energy put out from uranium nitride with a N-15 isotope over uranium dioxide would be lost making the N-15 from N-14 in the reactor. So It'd be stupid anyway. I was just thinking in basic chemistry knowledge, that maybe the nitrogen had something to do with its enthalpy, not too much about the nitrogen blocking uranium-238 capturing a neutron. But then that leads to more questions... Nevermind lol.\n\nI think uranium nitride with just plain old nitrogen-14 would produce more energy in a reactor than the uranium dioxide since there's more uranium in the crystal lattice, right? Like I said it's beyond my level of knowledge at the moment. I was just thinking out loud pretty much.",Chemistry

">I think it was Bohr who said ""the universe is inherently unknowable"". It's hard to say what pressures we place on the space of ideas we have about the world without being able to examine things from a nonhuman perspective. I think people find solace in attributing order and meaning to the patterns we observe and our place inside them. That might be limiting us from a more integrated view of nature - the word ""uni verse"" already attributes a singular harmony to reality, but it's entirely possible it's all a discordant chaotic mess in the end. I'm not sure where that leaves us considering we do still make an ""unreasonable"" level of progress as you say. \n\nI don't disagree on any particular point. :)\n\n>It's also possible the laws of the universe - which I would argue ultimately stem from the least action principle, that is itself formulated in terms of the behavior of a presupposed system - are self-organizing and emergent, in that they are imposed through consensus rather than absolution. In that sense maybe there is no underlying structure or meaning beyond what is attributed, and that alone makes it real. Who knows :)\n\nMmmm, it seems unlikely to me that all underlying structure is emergent — after all we seem to have no problem identifying phenomena that appear to be fundamental so far.  Surely some (arguably most; yes condensed matter I'm looking at you! :) dynamics are emergent though.\n\nIn any case, even if there is an underlying system I guess what I'm trying to articulate is that the principles of that underlying system don't need to be elegant, or even integrated into a single cohesive model.  It may be the case that the underlying principles are really just multiple unrelated ""models""/systems/frameworks all cobbled together in what intuitively seems like a ""hacky"" or ad-hoc way from our human perspective.\n\nPlaying ""god"" for a minute, one could perhaps look at all the final underlying principles of physics and characterize them as ""well we slapped this idea together with these two, and then glued it all together using *this* one, and by golly would you look at that: it can sustain intelligent life! who'da thunk it?""\n\nAs much as I *abhor* the anthropic principle and consider it a non-explanation for any phenomenon in general, I'll admit it is still entirely possible (perhaps even probable if some flavor of cosmic inflation is true) that those underlying principles just happen to be random and we were lucky enough to win the anthropic lottery. :p\n\nAnyhow, cheers and thanks for the interesting convo! :)",Physics

"I found this on the World Wide Web:\n\nNo shape can “amplify” sound.\n\nSound being a pressure wave in air, it has a fixed energy, which dissipates with distance from the source.\n\nIf you want to maximise the amount of that energy you capture, a parabolic dish can focus that energy down to a point, which has the effect of concentrating it there. The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a “beam” of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it’s coupled poorly to the air, it won’t produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not “amplify”, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air. Horns work either way around - as a receiver, the human ear is somewhat like a horn; many animals have very obviously horn-shaped ears which acts as a combined horn + parabolic reflector.\n\nby Graham Cox, BSc (hons) from University of East Anglia (1993)",Physics

Then reversing the time,  you find that the transformation time is swapped.\n\nMore concretely, let A to B transformation takes X time but B to A transformation takes Y time when played forward in time.  Now, if you see a recording and find that B changes to A in X time, you know that recording is played backward in time.  You have just broken time-symmetry since you can determine if the recording is played forward or backward in time. \n\nOf course, as others mentioned.

Again since it's dependent on concentration, if you have a really concentrated amount of acid, it can easily go negative. \n\nYou can also use an online pH calculator like this one [https://sensorex.com/ph-calculator/](https://sensorex.com/ph-calculator/). \n\nThe damage depends not just on pH but also the exposure site (eyes), duration, thoroughness of washing, the type of chemical etc. So using pH alone to tell how much damage was done is a bit meaningless.

"Not really. The vast majority of the physics we know today comes from experimental data analysis first.\n\nThis doesn't mean that we only add random parameters but the first stage in writing new physics is describing the phenomenon and make the math work. Then afterwards you can prove a more comprehensive theory that gives you the intial explanation as a result and that hopefully has some observable aspects that can help you verify it is actually correct.\n\nThis is not a ""new"" thing, the evolution from just describing motion to Newtonian physics to only afterwards the Hamiltonian equation is an example. Or Bohr and Planck ""inventing"" discrete energy and angular momentum before quantum mechanics was a thing to explain some experiments.\n\nAnd after you've done all this you still have to verify with experiments that you theory is correct. You could potentially have you hundreds of different theories that all give you the known physics as limit cases but still are fundamentally different, you can't just choose one unless it is able to predict something you can't already explain. And right now that's difficult because experiments going beyond the known phenomenons would cost trillion of dollars.

"So it sounds like your less confused about why it's exothermic and more confused about how a metastable system can change phase exothermically. But the thermodynamics doesn't care. Thermodynamics only states how energy will change eventually, there's absolutely no timeline on that change. In other words, thermodynamics states that when the solution crystallizes, it will be exothermic by X amount. That could happen immediately if you cool it too fast and don't achieve that metastable state, or it could happen the moment you give a metastable state a nucleation site. That energy is coming from all the interactions formed and lost (lost interactions with water, gained bonds between ions, in this case), so that energy comes only comes into play when it actually crystallizes. \n\nI'm not going to explain why crystallizing sodium acetate is exothermic here.

"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn’t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I’m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone’s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. “Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air” (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I’ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There’s nothing saying the second law efficiency can’t be better than 5%, and also it doesn’t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won’t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation “Lackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.” In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won’t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don’t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics
"Even if we went to 0% emissions immediately, it would take nature a very long time (order of millennia) to recapture all the excess CO2.

The wave only models have been tried and they failed.\n\n\n  “It is however tempting to argue that the\nconceptual underpinnings of the quantum theory of radiation and the concept of a photon can be best thought of as involving a classical electromagnetic field plus the fluctuations associated with vacuum.\nHowever, advances in quantum optics have brought forward new arguments for quantizing the electromagnetic field, and with them deeper insight into the conceptual nature of photons. With such examples as quantum beat phenomena, the quantum eraser, and certain two-photon interference phenomena, as discussed later in this book,\nit becomes necessary to think of the photon as a quantum mechanical entity whose basic physics is much deeper than the semiclassical theory plus vacuum fluctuation logic.”\nQuantum optics Scully and Zubairy page 20",Physics

"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics

"I'm not sure what would happen (engineer, not physicist), but i think you'd basicly be using 'all of space' as your energy source. At t=0+, when the valve is opened, the water is pulled up, but that force actually acts both ways, trying to equalize the pressure, and thus 'pulling' on the space end of the tube. This makes sense because space is not a 100% true vacuum, there are still some particles, but they are so sparse that the pressure is effectively 0.  Since space is infinitely more massive than water in the tube, it will seem like a unidirectional force and thus 'free energy', even though the system is trying just as hard to suck the sparse particles in as to push water up. Moving the water just ends up being infinitely easier, and thus the outcome that ends up occuring.",Physics

"The velocity at the outlet is derived [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli%27s_law#Derivation). In the last line of the derivation, they assume the pressures outside the tank and at the top of the fluid column are both atmospheric, but that's not the case here. So what you want is the second-to-last equation, which contains both the contributions from the height of the tank, and from the pressure difference.\n\nAnd you can see how that varies as you change the position of the hole in the tank. If the pressure difference between inside and outside is dominant, then moving the hole up or down will have little effect on the flow velocity, and the velocity will be proportional to the square root of the pressure difference.",Physics

But the overall entropy is determined by factors such as the crystal lattice energy, the sphere of hydration and the disorder (entropy) of the solvated ions. so not the easiest calculations but it can be done.\n\nIn short the entropy change for the dissolution of calcium chloride would be positive do too the factors I mentioned but the entropy change for the dissolution calcium oxide would be negative and not allowed by the second law of thermodynamics so it stays in its crystalline form.",Chemistry

However, to explain further. \n\nBecause it’s a constant angle, the amount of light contained within that cone is constant, so if you’re really far away from the source, the surface containing all that light is super spread out.

"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry

Pretty much everyone has electricity available at home, even in pretty rural areas. There is almost no infrastructure for hydrogen anywhere.\n\nThat being said, hydrogen production may become more significant over the coming decades, but probably not for use in fuel cells.

"If by expired you just mean outlasts its sell-by or use-by date, but is still sealed up inside the bottle or can, then probably not much. If the seal is still good and no air can get in, then there won't be much decomposition in most cases.\n\nThe exceptions will be certain wines or beers which still contain some live yeasts - you can tell which ones these are because there will be some visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\n\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\n\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as ""mother of vinegar"". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\n\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it. This may subsequently grow mould, but it would be useless long before it got that far.",Chemistry

Temp or talent agencies might be the way to go, I think some others mentioned that as well. \n\nA lot of companies don't want to take the risk with someone straight out of school so they're more comfortable knowing they can give you the boot easily lol! \n\nIt's all very ironic because I told myself I'd never ""stoop so low"" as to be a temp... I'm a distinguished chemist after all! I'm glad my stubbornness didn't get the best of me and I really am grateful for the contract I received because I was able to get a full time position from it.",Chemistry

"You're missing the point of the question.  It's not ""can you measure the velocity of the bullet"".  Obviously, you can, by measuring the shift.\n\nThe question is whether the observer sees it as a lightspeed weapon.  Which they do.  They see the bullet leave the gun 10 ls away (10 seconds after it actually does), and hit them 10 seconds later (total travel time of 20 seconds).\n\nFrom their perspective, they watched it travel 10ls in 10 seconds.\n\nI notice you've stopped responding to the other string where we've shown you can't do basic math.  Any particular reason?",Physics
Bromine is considered an impurity in steel; it upsets the crystal structure in a manner which renders the steel more likely to fracture.,Chemistry

"For DIY just get some really tiny amount of fluorescein, and you're golden (or yellow-green actually). The glow is induced by blue light and up (UV). You can cheat with tonic water.\n\nMany elements (mostly metals) ""shine"" in X-ray part of the spectrum, excited also by X-rays. For liquid water your best bet would be Cherenkov radiation: pass some super fast electrons through it, and they will produce light. Not sure if strong enough X-rays wouldn't make water glow, who knows… don't have enough courage to check that ☺",Chemistry
"that makes a lot of sense thanks! does that mean that say: 1. You are on earth, time moves how it does on earth. 2. You move further and further away from earth, time speeds up as you move away. 3. You are approaching a massive celestial body, with larger gravitational field than earth. It means that the time would then go faster on earth, than it would on the body you are on, right? and does the perception of time change in anyway?",Physics

Would someone who didn't know about GR think it was elegant before it was discovered?  I'm not convinced.,Physics
Yes it’s the same concept as ohms law but you would have to have Resistance or another factor to get you to the point that you can make the equation for a final answer,Physics
"Start simple. \n\nModelling things like this usually involves calculating the result numerically because the analytic results can get out of hand quickly. \n\nThe simplest numerical method is finite difference on a regular grid - you're essentially sampling the field at the grid points. Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics
I'm new to physics. I want to have a list of math book that fully covered all the prereq i must have to learn graduate physics and advanced physics.

"The bullet Is in a different reference frame than you (watching the bullet) and the shooter. Time dilation and length contraction will ensure that the bullet will  take 20 seconds to reach you, however you will not measure the bullet coming towards you in the same amount of time due to time dilation.",Physics
"I mean you could just use it immediately in the plant so you don't have to store huge huge vats of it plus it doesn't have to be 100% hydrazine.

"If you pile up electrons in a hypothetical chamber, they would occupy higher and higher energy levels because they repel each other and because they are fermions.\n\nThe first thing you would see is that nuclear reactions happen with the gas inside the chamber. The high density electrons would turn some of the protons into neutrons. You would see strange, stable isotopes that never occur in nature.\n\nIf you increase the electron density even further, you would start to see muons in the chamber. The electron energy levels are now so high that the system can gain energy by turning an electron into neutrinos and a muon in a low energy level.\n\nIf you go even higher, you fill up muon and electron energy levels. At some point, you have enough energy to create even tauons, which now pile up in the hypothetical chamber.\n\nThere's also the competing process that putting a lot of charge in one spot costs a lot of energy and a lot of energy in one spot can give you a black hole. It's not so easy to calculate when this would happen though with interacting fermions and all.",Physics
"I agree that it's important to emphasize that the interference pattern is not seen in real time, but I think she's being too dismissive about the fact that the interference pattern can be reconstructed after the fact. Her analogy, in which she removes coins, seems pretty bad. After all, we're not choosing to remove those detections that will leave an interference pattern behind, we're just removing those detections that are entangled with detections from D4. The fact that an interference pattern remains is still interesting.",Physics

"This is honestly really reassuring to me, because when I first watched the PBS Spacetime video on the DCQE I came away very confused, even after a second viewing.\n\nI know many on /r/physics really dislike Sabine, but her stance that quantum entanglement is misunderstood (sometimes even by professional physicists) because it's called ""entanglement"" rather than ""correlation"" seems correct to me (granted, as a statistician)",Physics
we do this in our organic chemistry labs haha it's not very hard,Chemistry
"No, it is not. Those websites and alleged ""professionals"" are full of it. You are right, use an alkaline solution and surfactants to clean grease.\n\nWhile acid catalyzed hydrolysis of lipids is a viable method to break down some of the deposits, you would not do it with a very dilute acetic acid. Besides, this will corrode the exposed metal surfaces.\n\nSoot / carbonaceous residue, on the other hand, is very difficult to remove once it has reacted with the underlying surface. You should try a dry method first, with mechanical abrasion. Failing that, you could use something like peroxide to try to bring it into solution, but it will also oxidize everything else it contacts.",Chemistry

"Sure, but I was just trying to give order of magnitude comparisons to three other ""flagship"" efforts. JWST came to mind because it's just about to launch.\n\nYou can't compare a flagship experiment to a small-scale experiment like TESS; the whole thing is smaller than a car and the lenses fit in the palm of your hand. I mean, by that same logic you could say TESS is way overpriced, because the ground-based Zwicky Transient Facility can also detect some exoplanets, and it only cost the US government $10 million, 95% less than TESS.",Physics
