"1)  You’d also need remnants of the integrase that enables reverse-transcribed DNA to be integrated into the genome.\n\n2)  Your cells are all currently chock-full of mRNA molecules.  If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around, it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome, which would be really bad for your cells.  The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA *specifically*.\n\n3)  If it did, all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID (well, a part of it).  And how do you fight off cells with COVID?  Your immune system!  The cell would continue to make spike proteins, and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins, like the spike protein, and then killing them.  Basically, your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections.",Biology

"What I got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health. Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology

"[How spray bottles work](https://home.howstuffworks.com/question673.htm).\n\nThe sensitive components in hand held trigger sprayer may include a spring, one-way valve, a tiny rubber ball in the non-return-valve and the spray nozzle.  \n\nYou won't know what these materials are in any given spray bottle.  They are usually going to be very cheap materials with no real life time.  Any one of these materials can react badly to one of your chemicals.  Brutally honest, they really aren't designed to last more than a single bottle or two.\n\nInvestigate hardware stores for pesticide/herbicide hand sprayers.\n\nThose hand and pump sprayers will have recommended uses that may include high pH, low pH, solvent, salt, etc.  They should also have labels that say NOT SUITABLE FOR ACID OR SOLVENTS.  Pick one that suits your needs and put a label on it.  Only use it for that chemical.\n\nFor instance, a brass nozzle will definitely survive some chemicals forever but 100% die within seconds for other chemicals.\n\nThe cheap hack for low-budget cleaners is to use the original packaging.  For instance buy a box of 24 Windex bottles instead of 1 big refill bottle.  It's not great packaging waste, but the next step us is probably going to be a $200 reusable spray bottle or electrostatic sprayer.",Chemistry

"> but the fact of the matter is that you can always generate a theory to explain any given phenomena.\n\nPresumably true. However, accomplishing that gets more difficult as you add more and more phenomena to be explained.\n\nIt's easy to come up with some explanation for a single data point, but ten? Twenty? After a while your variables become too convoluted and your ad-hoc rationalizations reach a critical point of nonsense.\n\nIt's very, very difficult to make a theory fit all the data points and observations we've accumulated about the universe.

"I think the emergent property argument, at least as I’ve heard Sean Carroll say in other contexts, is something similar to how physicists view emergent properties in statistical mechanics. That is to say, there is no such thing as the temperature of a single atom, nor the pressure of a single atom, but rather these macroscopic properties (of a gas, say) can be very accurately modeled as emerging from the many trillions of well-understood kinetic collisions of those atoms. In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we’ve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don’t fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

"I worked on this experiment. AMA\n\nBoron-10 has a high capture cross section for neutrons, and the cross section increases as 1/v. The neutrons in this experiment are ""ultacold neutrons"" (E < a few hundred neV) so 10B has a very high capture cross section. The capture reaction is 10B (n,alpha) 7Li.\n\nThe detector is built like a sandwich. On the outer edges are ~20 nm of 10B. The interior layer is ZnS, a scintillator. In the middle there is acrylic that has wavelength-shifting fibers (WLSF) built into it. From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs. This allows for us to look for coincident signals between two PMTs, which significantly suppresses (and more importantly, stabilizes!) background noise from ~250 Hz to ~0.5 Hz.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

"Any virus will be under selection for higher transmissibility / infectivity. Not because of any ""want"", natural selection doesn't require desires. Most viruses have relatively high mutation rates, and while the vast majority of these mutations will be harmful to viral replication, some may improve transmission. Thanks to high replication rates in hosts (ofther factors being equal), any variants with higher transmissibility will quickly come to dominate the viral population.\n\nUntil recent decades, it was believed that viruses were under selection for *less* virulence (which FYI, means ""disease severity or lethality""), because a virus that rapidly kills or incapacitates its hosts will encounter fewer hosts to infect. For example the 1918 H1N1 influenza was remarkable for being rapidly lethal in susceptible hosts, with some infected with severe disease going from asymptomatic to dead in under a day. This actually hindered its spread, as the infected had only a very brief window of time to spread the disease. It perhaps should come as no surprise that modern relatives of H1N1 are far less virulent.\n\nHowever, there are some important exceptions. If a virus is normally transmitted in a pre-symptomatic stage of infection, there will be little selection for less virulence. For transmission, it wont matter much if all infected drop dead if there are many days in which hosts are infections and in contact with others.\n\nAnd if a virus relies on the same mechanism for both transmissibility and virulence, then the positive selection for transmissibility can entail some selection for higher virulence. For example, the binding affinity of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein for host ACE receptors has effects both on lowering the effective infectious dose / inoculum (thus increasing  transmissibility), as well as increasing the rate of viral replication within hosts, plausibly leading to viral replication outpacing host immune response. The Delta variant has nearly doubled transmissibility compared to wild type, and somewhat higher virulence in some host age groups. Here, its possible that the expected selection for higher transmissibility is also bringing some selection for higher virulence.",Biology

"Agreed on false equivalence; I am not advocating MOND, or suggesting that it's a superior alternative to fit observational evidence -  we indeed have sufficient models for this. What I am suggesting however is that the largest technical breakthroughs in a theory tend to be ""hacks"" in the sense that, without a broader framework, they stitch together potentially disparate mathematical techniques in order to parsimoniously explain observations. This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe. This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it. Instead I am suggesting that these models hint at a deeper narrative we haven't grasped and that is reflected in their simplicity and disjointedness.",Physics

In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we’ve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don’t fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

"This isn't the right narrative. The correct story is that there are at least two contributions to DE which sum up to the observed value. One of them comes from a generic prediction of QFTs. This term is, in fact, hard to calculate and depends on things that we can't yet probe. But it doesn't matter because there's another contribution from GR. This one is an integration constant. That is, it is a free parameter not predicted by anything. So the observed number is the number from QFT plus the number from GR. You can see that it doesn't matter what the QFT number is since you can get to any possible observed number by changing the number from GR to match.\n\nNow someone familiar with this topic knows that I have swept a big elephant under the rug. The numbers in question are a bit silly. The number from QFT seems to be something in the range of 10^120 times the measured value. So the GR number has to be 1-10^120 in the same units. Now, there's no problem with it being negative, but some physicists are surprised that these two seemingly unconnected areas of physics have two numbers that are so closely related. Of course people have developed various solutions to this, so it is possible to relate them, but they aren't really testable at the moment.",Physics

Learn what an orbital is and all these things. From there there are some very important principles like electronegativity which will lead you towards reactivity. Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration). If you don‘t understand these things you won‘t really understand chemistry but rather be learning facts. \n\nNow if you know all that stuff or once you‘ve learned that, start with basic things like acid-base chemistry and redox chemistry.

Viruses exist to only to replicate. \n\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them. \n\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection. \n\nSome viruses cause little, if any, ill effect on the host.\n\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time. \n\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the host's life. \n\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death. \n\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant long-term health issues \n\nMany viruses are host specific, meaning they can only infect a certain specie(s).  \n\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host specie(s).  \n\nThoes infected cells are ""hijacked"" by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus.  \n\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control. \n\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses. \n\nThe more the virus is able to replicate, the higher the probability of a mutation occurring. \n\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process.  Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful dead-ends for the virus. \n\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful. \n\nA ""beneficial"" mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate, in greater numbers, infect different cellular systems or even infect other species.\n\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new  specie(s), it becomes a novel virus for the new host(s). \n\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus. \n\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no ""programed"" immune response to combat the novel viral infection.  \n\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded, the probability of a successful mutations increases. \n\nAs the virus mutates through host replication, it may become more virulent on the host. \n\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host, it often leads to an evolutionary dead end - in other words, if all the hosts are killed by a virus, the virus won't be able to replicate and will go extinct.\n\nOver time, natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent. \n\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host. \n\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population. \n\nOver time, the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population.  \n\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years. It's known as an evolutionary ""arms race"". \n\nViruses have always, and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet.  \n\n----------------------------------\n\nAgain, I tried to make the information very simple and loose.  I left our a tremendous amount of information in hopes to provide some insight without confusion.",Biology

"Sorry if I was brief above, but you just told the wrong narrative. The contribution cancellation you describe may hold at any given loop-order in the perturbative expansion of the vacuum energy coming from QFT. The problem with gravity is that it’s non-renormalizable. If you did the procedure you discuss above at a given loop-order, at the next level of the expansion, you’d have to perform another tuning, one independent of the first. QFT’s vacuum energy is radiatively unstable in the presence of classical GR. \n\nFurthermore, in saying the QFT prediction is terrible, I meant that if one wanted the 1-loop contribution to be THE dark energy, one would hope that contribution matches the observed value, or is close. Due to the mismatch, one has to rely on a fine tuning which then removes the ability to predict the vacuum energy.\n\nFinally, this all assumes that DE is a cosmological constant (cc), which isn’t actually required by the data. There are different manners of obtaining the current expansionary behavior (and its implied source).",Physics

"Could you elaborate more on your second law of thermodynamics claim? And also more broadly why you think the energy required to capture carbon must be greater than or equal to the energy we gained from it initially. After looking more into it, I’m a little more skeptical. \n\nYou can see here (https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=73&t=11) that different sources produce different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same amount of energy produced. When climeworks or anyone else captures CO2, there will be a fixed energy cost. It won’t vary based on whether the CO2 being captured came from burning coal or natural gas or from some natural process. All of these will generate CO2 with different amounts of energy produced. Like I said before, carbon capture isn’t trying to reverse the initial carbon emission process. The CO2 ends up bound in a different molecule or solid than it initially was before it was emitted. In fact, when gas phase CO2 binds to a typical adsorbent, it is energetically favored for the CO2 to be bound, so that energy will be released in the form of heat. This heating up of the material upon CO2 adsorption is actually problematic sometimes since the heat has to be dissipated for more CO2 to bind, depending on the way CO2 binds to the material. \n\nIn this type of adsorbing set up, the main energy cost is associated with desorption of the CO2. The energy inputted to desorb the CO2 is completely independent of the energy gained when the coal or oil was burned. The energy needed to desorb the bound CO2 depends only on the specifics of the adsorbing materials, and we are capable of generating materials with a large range of adsorption enthalpies.",Physics

"So the glucose we get from gluconeogenesis and eating food will be exactly the same in structure, however the function of the glucose at any point in time might differ to suit the body’s current needs. Gluconeogenesis only occurs when you are low on fuel. (Hungry)\n\nIf hungry —> glucose is broken down for energy\n\nIf not hungry —> glucose is converted to fuel-storage molecules.\n\n\nEXPLANATION: \n\nWhen you eat a meal but are not starving, your body is not short of energy, so the food you eat won’t be broken down to produce energy as it would basically be wasted (it’s more complicated but is sufficient to explain my point). Instead, the body converts the glucose into fuel-storage molecules such as glycogen and fat to give the body an emergency fuel source.\n\nHowever, when you are starving, your body is low on glucose. The body needs to maintain a steady glucose concentration for survival, so it produces glucose by gluconeogenesis. This glucose has a different function than the glucose we ingest because in this case, we are starving and need fuel to survive. So instead, the glucose is broken down to produce energy for the body.",Biology

"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics

The bullet is first seen when it exits the gun as it is shot.\n\nHere's the process, second by second:\n\n* T+0:  The bullet leaves the gun\n* T+1:  Bullet is 9.5 ls away, first light is 9 ls away\n* T+2:  Bullet is 9 ls away, first light is 8 ls away\n* T+3:  Bullet is 8.5 ls away, first light is 7 ls away\n* T+4:  Bullet is 8 ls away, first light is 6 ls away\n* T+5:  Bullet is 7.5 ls away, first light is 5 ls away\n* T+6:  Bullet is 7 ls away, first light is 4 ls away\n* T+7:  Bullet is 6.5 ls away, first light is 3 ls away\n* T+8:  Bullet is 6 ls away, first light is 2 ls away\n* T+9:  Bullet is 5.5 ls away, first light is 1 ls away\n* T+10:  Bullet is 5 ls away, first light reaches observer\n* T+11:  Bullet is 4.5 ls away, observer sees T+2 (9 ls)\n* T+12:  Bullet is 4 ls away, observer sees T+4 (8 ls)\n* T+13:  Bullet is 3.5 ls away, observer sees T+6 (7 ls)\n* T+14:  Bullet is 3 ls away, observer sees T+8 (6 ls)\n* T+15:  Bullet is 2.5 ls away, observer sees T+10 (5 ls)\n* T+16:  Bullet is 2 ls away, observer sees T+12 (4 ls)\n* T+17:  Bullet is 1.5 ls away, observer sees T+14 (3 ls)\n* T+18:  Bullet is 1 ls away, observer sees T+16 (2 ls)\n* T+19:  Bullet is 0.5 ls away, observer sees T+18 (1 ls)\n* T+20:  Bullet impacts, observer sees T+20 (0 ls - impact)\n\nSo, the observer sees the bullet travel the whole 10 ls distance in the 10 second window of observation.\n\nThus, the OP's interpretation is correct.",Physics

"In quantum field theory (which we know to work pretty damn well), in principle there are certain processes that are allowed to happen. Those processes are called ""Charge-Parity symmetry violating"". There's one parameter (called Θ) in our equations that determines how frequent those processes should occur, and this is something we have to measure experimentally and cannot derive theoretically, just like the masses of particles, their charges or how strong certain interactions are.\n\nAnd we experimentally find that those processes...have never occured once since we started looking for them in the 70's. So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Θ is zero. We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\n\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem. And it comes as natural as the Higgs-mechanism. It's almost too good to be true.",Physics

The energy you need to move the water initially will always be greater than the energy of the air bubble moving. If you move a small amount of water there will be a smaller pressure difference and the bubble will move slower. If you have a lot of water to begin with(i.e. a long tube) the pressure difference will also be smaller. Moving a lot of water in a small tube will have a greater effect on the pressure but require more energy and give less room for the bubble to move.,Physics
"Disagree. I'm not a knee-jerk anti-nuclear wingnut, but given the dramatic progress in intermittent renewables over the past decade, the use-case for nuclear is substantially smaller than many redditors seem to think it is. There's certainly a good case to be made for nuclear power for clean load-following or baseload electricity generation, but that's about it. My experience is mostly limited to American energy policy, but there's not much reason to believe other countries would have it substantially better when even the French nuclear industry is broadly declining.\n\nDue to the numerous safety regulations governing nuclear power plant construction, upkeep, and decommissioning (which, for the record, I think are a good thing), nuclear power plants are expensive as hell and take forever to build. kWh for kWh, they simply cannot compete economically with cheap silicon PV. Even if they could, a primarily nuclear energy industry would require new power plants being finished across the country every few days just to keep up with the rate at which they'd be decommissioned. Given how long they take to build, it's easy to see that the modern American nuclear industry is literally multiple orders of magnitude away from providing more than ancillary support to a broader green energy economy, powered primarily by solar and wind.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a universe where investment in nuclear energy deployment continued apace for the past few decades, laying the foundation for a zero-carbon nuclear future.

"What I'm trying to tell you, in like the nicest way possible, there isn't very much chemistry of heavy elements, because their radioactivity and short lifespan makes forming bonds very difficult.\n\nI'd still take chem and pay attention in inorganic classes, we had a module on lanthanide and actinide chemistry.\n\nHowever there's much more study in physics of the properties of super heavy elements.\n\nThe TLDR is super heavy elements don't exist long enough to do any meaningful chemistry, and it's likely not going to be the ""next big thing""\n\nGo where your heart is, take chemistry for chemistry's sake, or take physics because you like radioactivity and the other physics that goes along with it.\n\nFrom another perspective, think about how much energy is in a radioactive decay, then think about how much energy is needed to break a bond. Radioactive decay produces far more energy than required to break a bond. So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here.

">To address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. \n\nA slight correction to this -- the CO2 doesn't really *re-emit* the photon.  Instead the absorbed photon excites the ro-vibrational degrees of freedom of the molecule, effectively increasing its kinetic energy, which is then re-distributed to other molecules (such as N2, O2, H2O) in the atmosphere upon collisions, effectively leading to increased kinetic energy content (=temperature) of the atmosphere.  This difference in the process is crucial for understanding the fine details of the greenhouse effect; however, it is almost trivial at the same time, given that the black-body radiation (mostly IR for something at \~300K) of a substance is temperature-dependent.",Physics

"\> would that change what we think we know about evolution?'\n\nNot really. If a species finds a stable niche that doesn't entirely disappear during episodes of mass extinction, it can remain morphologically similar for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nMost selection, at most times, drives species to remain near their local optimum in the fitness landscape. This equilibrium is punctuated by bursts of rapid evolution when the environment changes dramatically and the selection pressures a species is subject to change, or in small isolated populations where genetic drift can mean a random walk across the fitness landscape.\n\nAnd even in species that seem morphologically similar to those that existed hundreds of million years ago, there can be substantial evolution. Most organisms are in a ""Red Queen's"" race with faster evolving parasites and pathogens, so even though their gross appearance may match an unchanging local optimum of the fitness landscape, they probably had major changes to immune response, which wouldn't be visible in the fossile record.\n\nMy understanding is that the nautiluses we find today are scarcely distinguishable from some nautiloids that existed prior to the end Permian mass extinction, and morphologically similar to nautiloids from 500 Mya. Some lampreys haven't changed much in 360 million years.

Repeat for all unknown variables.

"I don't know that we have an *urgent* need for specific terminology to discuss alien life. Life outside of Earth is completely hypothetical. If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\n\nIt's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\n\nIf, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet.

"Biology is a very broad field. Introductory classes at university are typically vast and superficial in terms of the content. Specializing in a particular area of biology will  happen as you advance in your degree, taking more elective classes and focusing on your interests. Granted, this is how things usually work in the U.S., and I'm not sure where you are. \n\nIn the US, biologists with a bachelors degree work introductory level jobs in their field.  Many work as laboratory technicians or in other areas depending on their specialty. Advanced degrees (Masters, Doctorate) or certificates are required for more focused jobs with better pay. The coursework required to become proficient in these fields tends to be rigorous and require a lot of studying and focus. The jobs themselves have a range of salary and expectations - it's too broad of a field to get more specific than that. \n\nMajoring in biology is becoming a bit more rare as the life science field is more diverse than in previous decades. Many colleges offer different majors to accommodate this and allow students to focus on their interests and the required requisite knowledge, and become better prepared for employment in their field. If you're more interested in genetics or the body, I suggest looking into majoring in genetics or taking advanced electives in that field. Anatomy & physiology or immunology may be interesting to you as well. These courses are usually only available to those who have done well in the introductory courses that you are likely taking right now. If your university has guidance counselors that help with scheduling, it may be worth having a meeting with them. Your university might also have statistics regarding where their graduates with biology degrees go next - medical school, graduate school, employment in industry, academia, etc.",Biology

I think those really are the choices, if the bike doesn't fall that means it is going straight when it is balanced or the handlebar rotates, making the bike turn.\n\n> But what’s left behind is the tilt\n\nGoing straight, there has to be a stable position, the forces need to be balanced. There can't be any inertia (other than in the forward direction), that permanently angles the bike to one side or the other. In your example, once the bike has rotated, the inertia to the right will either mean you tilt to the right and ultimately fall over to the right, or it will be slowed by a force coming from the contact between your bike and the road. As soon as you go forward, there isn't any total net inertia in another direction per definition (or you would move that way).\n\nAssuming the bike doesn't slip, it will rotate around the point where it touches the ground.

"The following is my personal opinion as a student of physics, i base it only on reason, might be wrong.\n\nMuch less so than gas.\n\nGases expand into whatever container is holding them, practically averaging out the amount of particles per cubed centimeter. Liquids tend to compress and expand much less because theyre bound together better than gas.\n\nAir moving over a wing will decompress as it makes its journey longer than the journey of air underneath the wing. This fast, decompressed air pulls the winged object upwards, right? Water wont ""give"" in the same way, as i said most liquids are resistent to compression and decompression. I would say the shape of the wing will definitely alter the object's trajectory, but the mechanics behind it are different from in a gas, and i wouldnt call it ""lift"".",Physics

It’s like when you leave  a full cup of water sit for a long period of time - where the water level used to be - but is no longer - there is a white film. That’s those dissolved solids.

The important bit here is that there is some greater force holding the cap down above and beyond just gravity pulling it down. It could be it's a tight fit or maybe even just surface tension of water where the cap contacts the lid. This results in a periodic phenomenon where expanding gas inside finally breaches the breaking force of the cap and then immediately depressurizes the container. Then the cap comes slamming down. The process repeats as the gas inside continues to expand.,Physics

If that is happening combining two streams gets you the same max temperature. But since some heat would immediately lost to surrounding air, having two flames in the area seems like it would mean less surrounding air to transfer heat to.\n\nWould it double the temperature, no. Increase, probably.\n\nNow if you could safely preheat the gasses in the second burner with the first, then it seems you could almost double the temperature. But this doesn't seem safe.\n\nReactions don't have a set final temperature, they have a set amt of heat released.

"I think you severely underestimate good scientists. If a collaboration as big with a machine as complex as LIGO can publish their raw data, there's no excuse for him not to.  Good scientists can provide the lengthy explanations of the context and analysis needed, but if your data can only be understood when passed through your magic black box that no one else is supposedly able to understand, that's as scientific as astrology.",Physics

"Need some advice for my sister who is a Chem major. She's unsure if to switch to BS in Chemistry or stick with BA for her career goals.\n\nShe's most interested in nuclear chemistry but could also see herself working as a food chemist as well. Earlier in college she was planning on going to Pharmacy school but has some reservations since she claims to not be good with biology. However, she doesn't want to close the door on it completely and may consider Pharmacy school again if she can't find a chemistry position.\n\nHer university offers a BA and BS degree in chemistry. After going through her potential timelines, there are only a few differences. The biggest difference is that BS degree only accepts two semesters of Calculus based Physics. While the BA accepts two semesters of college physics (algebra-based?). The other difference is that BS requires two semesters of research OR an internship. But BA doesn't require either to graduate, though she will obviously still try to get an internship if possible.\n\nShe already has one college physics course completed and I'm personally thinking she should just stick with BA but I don't want to give her bad advice. It's possible switching to BS may add another year to her schooling due to the possible research requirement if she doesn't get an internship. But if a BS in Chemistry makes her resume much more appealing, then I may advise her to switch.",Chemistry
